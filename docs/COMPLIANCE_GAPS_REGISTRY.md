# Compliance Gaps Registry (CRM2)

> **Permanent ledger of frozen decisions that are partially implemented, deferred, pending, or
> fixed-after-audit.** Purpose: never lose institutional knowledge as more agents build in parallel.
>
> **RULE — findings are never silently removed.** Every Yellow/Red finding must end in one of:
> **FIXED · DEFERRED · RATCHET · WONTFIX**, with evidence. A finding may move state (e.g.
> DEFERRED → FIXED) but its history stays. Companions: `docs/FROZEN_DECISIONS_REGISTRY.md` (what is

## Section A — FIXED gaps (discovered broken, fixed; keep history)

### A-1 · Coverage enforcement — 🔴 → 🟢 FIXED
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Original finding:** Coverage thresholds (90/85) were configured but **never enforced** — the
  gate did not run.
- **Root cause:** `@vitest/coverage-v8` not installed; `test` script ran `vitest run` **without
  `--coverage`**, so thresholds were inert. Measured actual once enabled: api-v2 85.7% lines /
  59.4% branch; sdk 48% (transport `client.ts` 0%).
- **Fix applied:** installed `@vitest/coverage-v8` (api-v2/sdk/logger); set `coverage.enabled:true`
  (always-on → enforced in `pnpm test`/CI); added SDK transport test `client.test.ts` (injectable
  `fetchImpl`, all 31 methods → sdk 100% lines); set honest **enforced** floors with a ratchet;
  corrected the stale "≥90" claim in ENGINEERING_STANDARDS + CI_CD_STANDARDS row 18.
- **Date fixed:** 2026-06-05
- **Evidence:** commit `642c362`; `pnpm verify` green with coverage now enforced.

### A-2 · Effective-From temporal usability gating — ✅ BUILT (ADR-0017)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (owner-requested capability, not a defect)
- **What:** master data had only `is_active` (binary) — no way to schedule a row to become usable
  on a future date and keep it visible-but-not-usable until then.
- **Built:** migration `0015_effective_from.sql` (7 tables + backfill `= created_at` + indexes on
  locations/users); the rule **USABLE ⇔ `is_active AND effective_from <= now()`**; `?active=true`
  on every master-data list now means USABLE; hard-coded operational reads gated (auth login,
  cases availableUnits/assignableUsers, rateTypes lookup, locations pincode cascade); user-settable
  `effectiveFrom` on create/update; admin lists show ACTIVE/SCHEDULED/INACTIVE + an Effective From
  column. SoT `docs/EFFECTIVE_FROM_STANDARD.md`; FROZEN_DECISIONS #30.
- **Date:** 2026-06-05
- **Evidence:** `pnpm verify` green (api 113 tests incl. gating tests in clients/auth/cases/cpv);
  live dev-API + browser verified (scheduled client → SCHEDULED chip, hidden from `active=true`).
- **Extended to CPV (2026-06-05):** migration `0016` adds `effective_from` to `client_products` +
  `client_product_verification_units` (the owner flagged CPV as missing it). Same USABLE rule;
  case-creation `availableUnits`/`allUnitsEnabled` now gate `vu` + `cp` + `cpvu`. **Also fixed a CPV
  UX bug (Finding A):** verification-unit mapping existed but was hidden behind a bare accordion
  chevron — added an active unit-count column + explicit "Manage units" action. CpvPage shows
  Effective From + ACTIVE/SCHEDULED/INACTIVE on links and unit enablements.

## Section B — DEFERRED gaps (frozen standards, approved, not yet built — NOT blockers)

These are scheduled for a future implementation phase. They are **not bugs and not missing
architecture** — simply not built yet. Each is built when its phase lands.

| ID | Item | Status | Governing standard | Target phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-1 | Universal DataGrid component | ✅ ROLLED OUT to all 6 lists (2026-06-06, `9c5fb5c`/`29ca2b0`/`36a633b`/`6b2bf77`) | `docs/DATAGRID_STANDARD.md` | Core + onRowClick on every admin/ops list (C-1..C-8 except CPV); advanced features B-3..B-6/B-13 still layer next |
| B-2 | Server-side pagination (envelope) | ✅ ALL list endpoints on Paginated<T> (2026-06-06) | `docs/PAGINATION_AND_LOADING_STANDARDS.md` | clients/products/users/verification_units/report_templates/locations/cases/rates converted; array-by-design endpoints (pincodes/dedupe/available-units/assignable-users/rates-history) stay arrays |
| B-3 | Column filters (§6 column search / §8 multi-column) | ✅ **FIXED + ROLLED OUT to all 8 lists** (2026-06-06) — clients/products/VU + users/templates/locations/rates/cases. Per-page `filterMap`+`filterable` | `docs/DATAGRID_STANDARD.md` | Shipped everywhere (CPV bespoke, excluded) |
| B-4 | Excel-style header filters (§7 multi-select) | ✅ **FIXED + ROLLED OUT** (2026-06-06) — `in` contract + grid `ColumnFilterSelect`; enum header multi-selects live on VU kind · users role · templates type · rates kind · cases status (replaced the old toolbar single-selects) | `docs/DATAGRID_STANDARD.md` | Shipped across admin + cases |
| B-5 | Saved views | ✅ **FIXED** (2026-06-15) — server-backed `saved_views` (mig 0051, own-user scoped like notifications/jobs); `/api/v2/saved-views` list/create/update/delete/set-default; `@crm2/sdk` `savedViews.*`; `SavedViewsPicker` in the DataGrid toolbar (reuses the grid's `queryKey` as resourceKey → all ~15 grids, zero per-page edits); captures every URL key except `page`, switch applies, default auto-loads on clean open. Audit Panel 4 PASS + 1 BLOCK (phantom `btn-primary`→`btn`) fixed | `docs/DATAGRID_STANDARD.md` §10 | Browser-verified on /admin/locations (create→switch→set-default→reload-auto-applies→delete). CARRY: delete confirm/undo; 23505 constraint-discrimination (unreachable today) |
| B-6 | Column visibility | ✅ **FIXED** (2026-06-06, Slice 2) — Columns menu on the universal grid; hidden ids persist in the `cols` URL key (§9/§12 interim before the saved-views store §10); all 7 migrated lists inherit it | `docs/DATAGRID_STANDARD.md` | Shipped |
| B-7 | Background-job UX | DEFERRED | `docs/PAGINATION_AND_LOADING_STANDARDS.md` §10–11 | Exports / workers phase |
| B-8 | Skeleton loading | ✅ **FIXED** (2026-06-09, Slice 9) — skeleton now band-gated to 300 ms–1 s (§6); 0–300 ms renders nothing (no flicker) | `docs/PAGINATION_AND_LOADING_STANDARDS.md` §6/§9 | Full §6 time-band ladder live in the DataGrid (`>8s`=background job stays DEFERRED → B-7) |
| B-9 | Hexagon loader (real %) | ✅ **FIXED** (2026-06-09, Slice 9) — `components/ui/HexagonLoader.tsx`; geometric hexagon, determinate (real % for staged jobs) + indeterminate (single-stage waits); reduced-motion-safe | `UI_STANDARDS.md`, `docs/PAGINATION_AND_LOADING_STANDARDS.md` §7/§8 | Indeterminate wired to the list-fetch now; determinate-% path awaits the operations/worker jobs (reports/MIS/export) |
| B-10 | Playwright E2E + axe a11y | DEFERRED | `docs/CI_CD_STANDARDS.md` (19/29) | First UI flow; CI step already stubbed |
| B-11 | OpenAPI generation | ✅ **FIXED (phase 1)** (2026-06-15, ADR-0031) — `platform/openapi` derives an OpenAPI 3.1 doc from the LIVE app (paths/methods/tags/security, zero new deps); committed `apps/api/openapi.json` via `pnpm openapi`. Request/response **schemas = phase 2** (zod single source) | `DOCUMENTATION_AS_CODE.md` (ADR-0011/0031) | Surface contract shipped; schema bodies deferred to the responses-into-zod migration |
| B-12 | SDK drift detection | ✅ **FIXED** (2026-06-15, ADR-0031) — **validate-don't-replace** (hand-written SDK stays authoritative). Two gates: (1) CI Part 21 re-emits + `git diff --exit-code openapi.json` (every route); (2) contract test asserts committed spec is current AND every `@crm2/sdk` path resolves to a real route (SDK→route, 0 violations). Reverse not asserted (FE uses `api()` for import/bulk/export/dashboard → would rot an allowlist; git-diff covers them) | `docs/CI_CD_STANDARDS.md` (21), ADR-0031 | Response-shape drift caught in phase 2; request drift already prevented by shared zod |
| B-13 | Universal export (current view / selected / all-matching; XLSX/CSV/PDF; `≥10k`=job) | 🟡 **PARTIAL — current-view + all-matching + `selected` DONE on ALL 7 ADMIN LISTS** (XLSX/CSV, `<10k` sync; `selected` mode added 2026-06-09 with row-select); see progress log | `docs/IMPORT_EXPORT_STANDARD.md` + `docs/DATAGRID_STANDARD.md` | Remaining: ops **cases** export · PDF · ≥10k report-worker job tier (streaming builders). Ops **tasks** (Pipeline) export shipped with the list itself (2026-06-11, current/all/selected, scope-honoring). |
| B-23 | Row selection + bulk actions (DATAGRID_STANDARD §15) | ✅ **FIXED** (2026-06-09) — shared DataGrid selection (checkbox col + select-all-page + "select all N matching" banner + bulk bar) on all 7 admin lists; built-in **Export Selected** (B-13 mode 2) + **bulk Activate/Deactivate** (per-row OCC per CONCURRENCY_AND_EDITING_STANDARD §1, per-row OK/CONFLICT/NOT_FOUND result) | `docs/DATAGRID_STANDARD.md` §15, `docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_EDITING_STANDARD.md` §1/§7 | Selection captures row `version` (Map) for OCC; `allMatching` disables versioned bulk (export still works). DON'T-REGRESS: scoped-resource bulk must enforce scope inside the per-row apply fn. |
| B-14 | Universal import engine (`@crm2/import-engine`: template/validator/mapper/processor + flow + validation report + import audit) | DEFERRED | `docs/IMPORT_EXPORT_STANDARD.md` | First import need (Clients/Products/Rates/Pincode/Users…) |
| B-15 | Authentication (login / JWT-pair + refresh / password set, web) — **SHIPPED** (ADR-0014, mig `0009_auth.sql`): scrypt passwords + `jose` HS256, `/api/v2/auth/{login,refresh,logout}`+`/me`, web login + Bearer + single-flight 401→refresh; dev `x-test-auth` seam is backend-test-only now. | ✅ **FIXED** (ADR-0014) | ADR-0014, ADR-0012 | Remaining: mobile rebase to `/api/v2/auth` (separate repo) + refresh-revoke-on-password-change — tracked, short access TTL mitigates. |
| B-16 | Report rendering engine (Handlebars/text → PDF) + CPV-scoped template overrides (client+product+vtype) | DEFERRED | BLUEPRINT report-engine section | Reports/operations phase. Superseded/absorbed by B-18 (ADR-0015). |
| B-17 | Verification Workspace — single page (Zion NewDataQC): per-task data-entry/MIS · assignment · FE-mobile images+data · report entry · auto-gen · Final Status + Case Report | DEFERRED | `docs/CASE_WORKSPACE_AND_REPORTING_FREEZE.md` §1, ADR-0015 | Operations phase — reuse `/cases/:id` behind a flag. Keystone. |
| B-18 | Per-client+product Reporting Engine — two kinds (MIS_EXCEL + CASE_REPORT), formats PDF/WORD/EXCEL, field/column mapping (FE data+images+seal), 200+ formats config-driven; extends `report_templates` 0008 | DEFERRED | `docs/CASE_WORKSPACE_AND_REPORTING_FREEZE.md` §2, ADR-0015 | Operations phase — generation via report-worker (PDF) + export engine (Excel); seed 200+ via import-engine. |
| B-19 | Admin Template Designer (design/upload MIS-Excel + Case-Report templates per client+product[+type]; versioned, immutable-once-used) | DEFERRED | `docs/CASE_WORKSPACE_AND_REPORTING_FREEZE.md` §2.2, ADR-0015 | Administration — extends the shipped Report Templates module. |
| B-21 | Rate Management — **SHIPPED as the FLAT one-table model** (ADR-0018, migs `0013_rate_management_flatten`+`0014_rate_types_lookup`), NOT the ADR-0016 4-table rebuild: one `rates` row `(client,product,VU,location,rate_type)→amount` effective-dated + a read-only managed `rate_types` lookup. The owner reversed the 4-table design mid-build → `rate_type_eligibility` + `service_zone_rules` + the eligibility trigger were dropped. | ✅ **FIXED** (ADR-0018 supersedes ADR-0016) | ADR-0018; `docs/RATE_MANAGEMENT_FREEZE.md` (superseded banner) | Shipped + browser-verified. Commission (FUCA) later phase. |
| B-20 | Territory (pincode/area) scoped assignment + assignment-history audit. Task Assignment (`0011`, commit `22a56c0`) ships **hierarchy** scope only (SA/MANAGER subtree/TEAM_LEADER direct reports). True territory matching (FE sees tasks in their pincodes/areas, per `MOBILE_API_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md` `assignedPincodes/Areas`) needs location on cases/users — neither exists in v2 yet. Reassignment overwrites in place (no append-only assignment history). | ✅ **FIXED — generalized far beyond the ask** (ADR-0022 Access Control 2.0): cases carry `pincode_id/area_id` (0031); assignments live in the generic `user_scope_assignments` (0034) wired per ROLE (`role_scope_dimensions`, EXPAND/RESTRICT) across 7 dimensions (PINCODE/AREA/CLIENT/PRODUCT/STATE/CITY/VERIFICATION_TYPE); visibility enforced centrally (`platform/scope`); admin UI (Roles screen + the user dialog Access tab) + bulk import/export; every layer fail-closed + audited. Residual ✅ CLOSED by the Pipeline milestone (2026-06-11, `12ba6b5`/`66d97db`/`fcce76e`): append-only `task_assignment_history` (mig 0036, immutability trigger) + `assignableUsers` = unit.worker_role ∩ hierarchy ∩ territory (per-task + intersection endpoints) + VERIFICATION_TYPE task-grain list legs (`taskPredicate`) live on `/api/v2/tasks`. | ADR-0022; migrations 0030–0035; `noRoleLiterals` gate | Shipped slices AC2.0 1–8 (2026-06-10/11), browser-verified. |

**Reason:** scheduled for future implementation; not architecture blockers. Build order:
MASTER_MEMORY §9.

## Section C — RETROFIT requirements (built pre-freeze; must upgrade later)

| ID | Component | Current state | Required future state | Target phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-1 | Master-data tables (Clients/Products via `MasterDataCrud`) | ✅ MIGRATED to DataGrid + server pagination (`4e7a8fd`) | — | DONE (reference impl) |
| C-2 | Verification Units page | ✅ MIGRATED to DataGrid + server pagination (`9c5fb5c`) | — | DONE |
| C-3 | CPV Mapping page | ✅ MIGRATED to the Universal DataGrid via the new additive `renderExpanded` master-detail prop (DATAGRID_STANDARD §20) — `client_products` list→`Paginated` envelope, server search/sort/filter, column visibility, date-range filters, export + import; the inline `UnitManager` accordion is preserved as the expanded row. (`2d461ae`/`066cbaf`/`183b76e`/`324592b`) | Universal DataGrid (row-expansion) | DONE — full parity with the 7 other admin lists; row-select/bulk deliberately excluded (B-23 scope) |
| C-4 | Rate Management page | ✅ MIGRATED to DataGrid + server pagination + global search; Revise/History → dialogs (`6b2bf77`) | — | DONE |
| C-5 | Location Management page | ✅ MIGRATED to DataGrid + server pagination + migration 0020 trgm/sort indexes (`29ca2b0`) | — | DONE (157k, EXPLAIN-verified <2s) |
| C-6 | User Management page | ✅ MIGRATED to DataGrid + server pagination (`9c5fb5c`) | — | DONE |
| C-7 | Report Templates page | ✅ MIGRATED to DataGrid + server pagination (`9c5fb5c`) | — | DONE |
| C-8 | Cases list page | ✅ MIGRATED to DataGrid + server pagination + onRowClick→detail (`36a633b`) | — | DONE |
| C-10 | **Concurrency/editing (OCC) retrofit — ALL pre-freeze admin modules** (clients/products/VU/CPV/rates/locations/users/templates + cases/tasks) | last-write-wins: `UPDATE … WHERE id=$1`, no version guard; `version` column missing on ~9 tables (only VU/rate_types/rates have it, VU's is an unenforced counter); no master-data change history (only `rates.rate_history`) | OCC per `docs/CONCURRENCY_AND_EDITING_STANDARD.md` (ADR-0019): add `version`; guarded UPDATE → 409 STALE_UPDATE; require version on update; append immutable audit/history; per-row bulk OCC; FE conflict dialog | Editing-standard retrofit (migration adds `version` + generic `audit_log`; new modules build it from day 1). See FROZEN #33. |
| C-9 | **Responsive-First retrofit — ALL pre-freeze screens** (app shell/sidebar, every feature page, dialogs, filters) | desktop-layout: persistent fixed sidebar (no mobile drawer), wide tables with no mobile card view, some non-responsive grids/dialogs → breaks `<768px` | responsive-first per `docs/RESPONSIVE_DESIGN_STANDARD.md`: sidebar→hamburger/Sheet `<lg`, table→card on mobile, mobile-up grids/dialogs, no horizontal overflow at 320/768/1024/1440 + Playwright viewport specs | Responsive retrofit (app shell first; table→card folds into the DataGrid build). See FROZEN #32. |

**Rule:** no NEW list ships without pagination + DataGrid; these pre-freeze pages migrate before GA
(also tracked in `CRM2_MASTER_MEMORY.md` §8).

**PROGRESS 2026-06-06 (`4e7a8fd`) — DataGrid epic started (vertical reference):** the Universal DataGrid
core + the server-pagination envelope shipped on the clients/products reference (C-1 ✅). DataGrid lives
app-internal at `apps/web/src/components/ui/data-grid/` (TanStack Table; NOT a new package). Core =
server pagination/sorting/global-search · skeleton/empty/error states · URL-state (keys `q/sort/dir/page/
size`) · sticky header · responsive `.rtable` card (the grid now owns it). **Next:** roll the DataGrid +
`pageQueryToParams`/envelope retrofit out to the remaining 16 list endpoints (C-2..C-8 + ops), then layer
advanced features (B-3 column filters · B-4 Excel header filters · B-5 saved views · B-6 column visibility ·
B-13 export · bulk/row-select · B-8 Hexagon loader + loader bands). **B-22 — ✅ FIXED (Slice 1B, see below).**

**PROGRESS 2026-06-06 — ✅ DataGrid + server-pagination ROLLOUT COMPLETE (`9c5fb5c`·`29ca2b0`·`36a633b`·`6b2bf77`, LOCAL/unpushed).**
B-1/B-2 done; C-2/C-4/C-5/C-6/C-7/C-8 ✅ MIGRATED (only C-3 CPV stays bespoke — master-detail accordion, no grid
row-expansion). 4 slices: (1) users·verification_units·report_templates `9c5fb5c`; (2) locations[157k] + migration
0020 (pg_trgm GIN + sort btree) `29ca2b0`; (3) cases (+ additive `onRowClick` on the Universal DataGrid) `36a633b`;
(4) rates — effective-dated/history, KYC null rows, global search, Revise/History→dialogs `6b2bf77`. Every slice:
green `pnpm verify` (api 165→192 · sdk 62) + Playwright 61/0 + Audit Panel (CEO + Principal + DB + Security +
Performance + Design + API/Contract, ledgers `docs/agents/*.md`; on slices where audit subagents hit the session
limit the CTO discharged the gap inline, logged in the ledger). Array-by-design endpoints kept as arrays:
`/locations/pincodes`, `/cases/dedupe|available-units|assignable-users`, `/rates/:id/history`. **Carried OPEN:**
~~B-22~~ ✅ (Slice 1B); ~~widen the e2e crash-guard to every envelope page~~ ✅ + ~~`viewport.spec` flake~~ ✅ (Slice 1C);
wire SDK-drift/contract CI gates (still DEFERRED — needs OpenAPI B-11/B-12); advanced DataGrid features
(B-3..B-6/B-13/bulk/keyboard-nav) still DEFERRED.

**ROLLOUT-TAIL Slice 1C — ✅ e2e crash-guard widening + viewport flake DONE (2026-06-06, test-only; CTO-discharged audit [CEO/Principal/Design] — logged in ledgers; Playwright 61 passed).**
`datagrid.spec.ts` crash-guard widened from 3 paths to ALL 10 envelope/options-consuming routes (clients·products·verification-units·users·
locations·rates·cpv·templates·/cases·/cases/new) — asserts shell+h1 survive AFTER data load (catches `.map` on an envelope OR `.items` on a
flat array). `viewport.spec.ts` flake fixed: added `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` after goto so the table→card cell-count
assertion no longer races the list fetch. SDK-drift/contract CI gates remain DEFERRED (need OpenAPI B-11/B-12).

**MASTER-DATA EDIT Slice — ✅ ADR-0020 correctable identity keys (clients + products `code`) DONE (2026-06-06; Audit Panel 6 roles; Security+DB+API/Contract PASS, CEO+Principal FLAG→RESOLVED, Design PASS).**
Owner-approved fix for "user typos a code and can't correct it." New **ADR-0020** (amends ADR-0001): a master-data `code` is editable while the row is
UNREFERENCED, locked (409 CODE_LOCKED) once in use. Reference impl on clients + products (shared `MasterDataCrud`): `UpdateClient/ProductSchema` gain
optional `code`; repo `hasDependents(id)` (EXISTS client_products|rates|cases) + `updateRow` (OCC-guarded, `SET code=COALESCE($2,code)`, unique→*_CODE_EXISTS);
service throws CODE_LOCKED pre-mutation if the code changed AND has dependents. FE: code input un-frozen on edit + helper "correctable only while unused (ADR-0020)"
+ friendly CODE_LOCKED message. api 217→220; sdk 63 (contract tests updated: code now optional); live-verified (HDFC CPV-referenced code-change→409, name-only→200,
fresh code-correct→200). **CEO/Principal FLAG (hasDependents covers only 3 referencing tables) → RESOLVED/false-positive (CTO):** the auditor cross-checked the
v1 `acs_db_final_version.sql`; the LIVE v2 schema has EXACTLY 3 tables with client_id/product_id (cases·client_products·rates — confirmed via live test DB +
v2 migrations; the 0012 eligibility/SZR FK tables were DROP CASCADE'd in 0013; invoices/kyc_rates/etc. are v1-only, 0 rows/0 tables in v2). hasDependents is
COMPLETE for v2 (the DB auditor confirmed correctly against db/v2/migrations). Stale "code immutable" service file-headers corrected. **ROLLOUT TODO (this task,
not jumping): apply ADR-0020 to VU·locations·templates `code`/`pincode` (+ users.username = login rename, no FK deps).** When new referencing tables land
(invoices/reporting in later phases), ADD them to the relevant `hasDependents` (DON'T-REGRESS: hasDependents must list every live FK referrer).

**ADR-0020 ROLLOUT cont. — ✅ templates + locations + users DONE (2026-06-06; Audit Panel DB+Security+Principal+CEO+Design 5/5 PASS).** Same proven
pattern: **report_templates** `code` (0 v2 referrers → `hasDependents`=false → always editable; lock wired+dormant), **locations** `pincode`
(`hasDependents`=EXISTS(rates) → `409 PINCODE_LOCKED`; lock test creates a rate referencing it), **users** `username` (login rename — NO FK deps since
refs are by uuid id → no gate, uniqueness→`USER_EXISTS`). Each: SDK Update schema +optional key; repo renumbered UPDATE `SET key=COALESCE($2,key)`
(audit verified `$N`↔params EXACT in all 3) + hasDependents + unique mapping; service gate (locations) / no-gate (templates·users); FE dialog key field
un-frozen + helper + lock message (locations pincode static `<p>`→editable input). The 2 pre-existing immutability api tests (templates·users) +
3 SDK contract tests updated to "unchanged when omitted". api 220→223; sdk 63; Playwright 64; browser-verified (users username editable). 4 stale
"immutable" doc-comments corrected. **DON'T-REGRESS: auditors must check `db/v2/migrations`/live DB for
FK referrers, NOT the v1 `acs_db_final_version.sql`.**

**ADR-0020 ROLLOUT ✅ COMPLETE — VU `code` DONE (2026-06-06; Audit Panel DB+Security+Principal+CEO+Design 5/5 PASS).** The last + trickiest entity:
VU's update merges the patch over the existing row + re-validates via CreateVerificationUnitSchema. Replaced the `CODE_IMMUTABLE` throw with the
`hasDependents` gate (EXISTS cpv_units|rates|case_tasks → 409 CODE_LOCKED); `merged` no longer forces `code:existing.code` (a permitted new code flows
through, still Create-schema-validated). repo.update writes `code = COALESCE($23, code)` — **$23 is a FRESH TRAILING param** appended after the dense
$1..$22 (audit-verified exact, no renumbering) + try/catch→UNIT_CODE_EXISTS. SDK `UpdateVerificationUnitSchema` un-omits code (optional, validated). FE VU
dialog: code un-frozen + CODE_LOCKED message. api 223 (VU test: name-edit→200, code-correct-unreferenced→200 v3, CPV-reference→409 CODE_LOCKED); sdk 63.
Removed the now-dead `CODE_IMMUTABLE` error enum (my change orphaned it). **✅ Option B now LIVE on ALL keyed admin entities: clients·products·VU `code` ·
templates `code` · locations `pincode` · users `username` — each correctable while unreferenced, locked once in use (users always — no FK deps).** CPV/CP
keys + rates composite stay immutable-by-design (recreate / Revise). **DON'T-REGRESS: when new FK referrers land (invoices/reporting), add them to the
relevant `hasDependents`.**

**MASTER-DATA EDIT Slice — ✅ CPV effective-from reschedule edit DONE (2026-06-06; Audit Panel Security+DB+API/Contract+CEO+Principal+Design 6/6 PASS).**
Closes the lone master-data gap where CPV had NO edit at all (every other admin list could already reschedule `effective_from` per ADR-0017). Added
`updateEffectiveFrom` (OCC-guarded, in-tx audited, mirrors the proven `setActive` pattern) to BOTH cpv sub-repos + service `update` (requireVersion) +
controller + `PUT /client-products/:id` & `PUT /cpv-units/:id` (MASTERDATA_MANAGE) + SDK `UpdateClientProduct/CpvUnitSchema` + `.update()` methods. FE:
`RescheduleDialog` (date input, OCC ConflictDialog on 409) on an Edit button on each link + unit row. **ONLY `effective_from` is editable — keys
(client/product/unit) stay immutable per ADR-0001** (dialog copy says so: deactivate+recreate to fix a wrong key). api 215→217; sdk 63 (client.test 66→68);
live routes verified (VERSION_REQUIRED / CPV_UNIT_NOT_FOUND); browser-verified the dialog. Design caught + fixed a token nit (`bg-black/40`→`bg-foreground/40`).
**OPEN (master-data mistake-fix, owner-raised):** a typo in an IMMUTABLE key (code/username/pincode/CPV-keys) still can't be corrected in place — only
deactivate+recreate. Making keys editable would reopen ADR-0001 (immutable+versioned codes for history/report coherence) → needs a decision (options:
keep deactivate+recreate · allow code-edit-while-unreferenced · hard-delete-if-unreferenced). FLAGGED to owner, not changed.

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 5 — ✅ COLUMN-FILTER ROLLOUT to all remaining lists DONE (2026-06-06; Audit Panel DB+Security+Performance+CEO+Principal+Design 6/6 PASS).**
Applied the (already-7/7-PASS'd) B-3/B-4 filter contract + grid UI to the 5 lists that lacked it — **users · report-templates · locations · rates · cases** —
joining clients/products/VU. Each: service `filterMap` + `resolveFilters` + echo; repo `filterClauses`; page `filterable`/`filterOptions`. Enum header
multi-selects REPLACED the old toolbar single-selects (users role · templates type · cases status; matches the VU-kind precedent — adds multi-select,
loses nothing; kept the `active`/status + rates clientId/productId toolbar selects). **Count-query join safety enforced per list** (the load-bearing
invariant): users filters only `u.*` (NOT manager `m.name`); cases only `cs.*`+`pa.name` (NOT `cl`/`p` — the lean COUNT doesn't join them); rates uses
the shared RATE_FROM so joined `vu.kind`/`l.pincode` are safe; locations/templates single-table. NO change to `platform/pagination.ts` or the grid core
(pure declarative reuse). Injection-safe (every filter column a hardcoded filterMap literal incl. join aliases; values bound; enums validated). `pnpm verify`
green; api 210→215 (+1 filter test per module); Playwright 64; **live dev API all 5 verified** (users role-IN→2, name→1; templates type→1; locations
state→12,754 on the 157k catalog via 0020 trgm; rates kind→2; cases status→1; all echoed). Large-table-text-filter RATCHET RESOLVED (locations 0020,
cases 0021 trgm already cover it). **CPV stays bespoke (excluded). NOTE: owner directive — future compliance-gap PRIORITIZATION is Administration-first;
this completed work (incl. cases) is kept.**

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 7 — ✅ DATE-RANGE filters (Created + Effective From) on all 7 admin lists; EXPORT honors them (2026-06-09; owner-requested "export for a from/to date").**
Extends the column-filter contract (`platform/pagination.ts`) with a new `FilterField` **`kind:'date'`** + `AppliedFilter` ops **`gte`/`lt`**: `resolveFilters` reads `f_<field>_from` / `f_<field>_to` (each optional, strict `YYYY-MM-DD` validation → malformed dropped, no SQL exposure); `filterClauses` builds a **half-open window** `col >= $n::date` AND `col < ($n::date + 1)` (so the To-day is inclusive). All 7 services add `createdAt` + `effectiveFrom` date entries to their filterMap (qualified to the COUNT query alias: `u.created_at`, `r.created_at`, else bare). **Export auto-honors them** — `exportData` already reuses `resolveFilters`, so the same `f_<field>_from/_to` flow into the file (no export-side change). FE: DataGrid gains a `dateFilters?:{id,label}[]` prop → a From/To `<input type=date>` pair per entry below the toolbar (URL-synced `f_<id>_from/_to`, merged into the query so list + export share them; inputs cap `max-w-[42vw]` so two never overflow a 320px phone — responsive gate). All 7 pages pass `dateFilters=[{createdAt,'Created'},{effectiveFrom,'Effective From'}]`. **`pnpm verify` green; api 277→282 (+5: 4 pagination unit + 1 clients date-range api), sdk 70; Playwright 65→66 (+date-range e2e).** Browser-verified on /admin/clients: 4 date inputs render; Created 2026-06-01..09 narrows 3→2 (April-dated row excluded); URL `?f_createdAt_from=…&f_createdAt_to=…`; **export honors it (June range→2 rows, April range→1 row, live-confirmed)**. **DON'T-REGRESS:** a `kind:'date'` filterMap column must exist in the COUNT query FROM (qualified alias); date inputs cap width to avoid mobile overflow.

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 10 — ✅ ROW SELECTION + BULK ACTIONS (B-23) + Export-Selected (B-13 mode 2) DONE on ALL 7 admin lists (2026-06-09; 4 commits f81a2c9·5afc895·e98ea4a·fff8a27, LOCAL/unpushed; Audit Panels 6/6 + 6/6 PASS).** Completes DATAGRID_STANDARD §15.
Built in 4 sub-slices (reference→rollout cadence): **(1)** shared DataGrid selection — checkbox column (select-all-on-page + per-row), "Select all N matching" banner, bulk-action bar (count + Clear), built-in **Export Selected**; selection is ephemeral (clears on search/sort/filter change, accumulates across pages); `allMatching` never holds all ids client-side. Export contract gained `mode:'selected'` + optional `ids` (additive); backend `resolveExport` parses ids; clients/products repo.list gained an `ids` filter (`id = ANY($n)`, bound, ANDed on top of the scoped query) + service exports NOTHING for an empty/invalid id set. **(2)** rolled Export-Selected to the other 5 admin lists (int `id = ANY($n)`; users `u.id = ANY($n::uuid[])`). **(3)** bulk Activate/Deactivate (clients/products reference) — selection refactored `Set<string>`→`Map<string,T>` to capture each row's `version` (the OCC token); new `platform/bulk.ts` (`parseBulkItems` caps 500/400s malformed + `applyBulkOcc` per-row → STALE_UPDATE=CONFLICT/404=NOT_FOUND/else rethrow); `service.bulkSetActive` reuses the version-guarded `repo.setActive`; `POST /bulk-activate|/bulk-deactivate` (own manage perm, before `/:id`); SDK `bulk.ts` (BulkItem/BulkRequest/BulkResult, additive); FE `BulkStatusActions` (per-row result summary; clears on clean run, keeps on partial; `allMatching` shows a hint). **(4)** rolled bulk to the other 5 (users uuid via `String(id)`).
**Per-row OCC** (CONCURRENCY_AND_EDITING_STANDARD §1/§7): each ticked row's captured version guards its write — a row changed since selection → CONFLICT, never a silent overwrite. **Per-row tx is REQUIRED** (Database ruling), not set-based (preserves OCC + per-row audit). `>500` = a later background-job tier.
**🔧 TEST-HARNESS FIX:** the api suite flaked ~1/319 non-deterministically once 3b's files landed — `fileParallelism:false` still let vitest spread files across forks, so one file's `TRUNCATE … CASCADE` raced a shared FK-parent table mid-query in another. Added `poolOptions.forks.singleFork` (apps/api/vitest.config.ts) → one serial process → 319/319 deterministic (verified twice). **DON'T-REGRESS: keep singleFork — the shared-DB integration suite is NOT safe across parallel forks.**
**Gates:** `pnpm verify` green; api 282→319; Playwright 12/12 datagrid (incl bulk-bar + selection tests) + a11y 11/11; live-browser verified the full bulk loop on /admin/clients (deactivate→bulk-deactivate 200→restored) + Export-Selected on /admin/users (uuid `ids` → 200). **Audit Panels:** sub-slice 1 CEO+Principal+Security+API-Contract+Database+Design 6/6 PASS; sub-slice 3a same 6/6 PASS; rollouts CTO-discharged consistency. **NEW OPEN (in ledgers, non-blocking):** partial-conflict retry holds stale versions until re-tick (UX polish); FE bulk-mutation Playwright test; server-side "act on all matching" bulk endpoint; **scoped-resource bulk must enforce scope inside the per-row apply fn (IDOR guard) when bulk reaches cases/tasks.**

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 9 — ✅ B-8/B-9 HEXAGON LOADER + §6 LOADING TIME-BANDS DONE (2026-06-09; LOCAL/unpushed; Audit Panel CEO + Principal-Engineer + Design-Quality 3/3 PASS).** Implements PAGINATION_AND_LOADING_STANDARDS §6/§7/§8 on the Universal DataGrid (built once → all 8 lists inherit it).
NEW **`components/ui/HexagonLoader.tsx`** — the ONE platform loader (geometric hexagon `<polygon>` outline; NO spinning circle / progress bar / bouncing dots — §7). Two modes: **determinate** (`percent` → outline fills via `stroke-dashoffset` on a `pathLength=100` hexagon + the `{value}%`/operation/sub-step; ONLY for genuine staged jobs per §8 maps) and **indeterminate** (`percent` omitted → a `25 75` dash marches the outline via the `.hex-march` keyframe + operation text only). NEW **`lib/useLoadingBand.ts`** — the §6 bands (`none` 0–300 ms / `skeleton` 300 ms–1 s / `loader` 1–3 s / `loader-op` ≥3 s), setTimeout-driven, resets on inactive. `DataGrid.tsx` wires them into the **first-load** path (`isLoading && band===…` so a stale band can't co-render with rows on the resolve frame; refetches keep prior rows + the "Updating…" hint). `index.css`: `.hex-march`/`.hex-fill` + a **`prefers-reduced-motion`** guard (static hexagon; `role=status` text still announces). +1 Playwright test (route-delays the clients list 1.8 s → asserts the `role=status` loader shows then clears).
**§6-vs-§8 RECONCILIATION (unanimous Audit verdict — does NOT reopen the freeze):** §6's 1–3 s row says "loader + percentage", but **§8 is the controlling rule** ("percentages MUST reflect actual work stages — never an animated guess"; its stage maps are report/MIS/case-creation jobs) and §9 mandates **skeleton rows, not a %**, for tables. A single list `fetchPage` is one round-trip with no knowable stages → any number would be the fabrication §8 bans. So list loads use the **indeterminate** loader (operation text, no number) and the determinate-% path is reserved for the staged operations-phase jobs. No ADR needed.
**Gates:** `pnpm verify` green; Playwright **11/11 datagrid** (incl. the loader test) + **11/11 axe**; **live-browser eval confirmed** the loader renders (`role=status`, aria-label "Loading Users", 2 hexagon polygons, `.hex-march` animating). FE-only — no API/SDK/SQL/contract surface. Audit applied 2 SHOULD-FIXes before commit (the `isLoading &&` one-frame-overlap guard; reduced-motion on the determinate `.hex-fill` transition).
**DON'T-REGRESS:** NEVER pass a fabricated `percent` to HexagonLoader for a single-stage wait (§8) — omit it for indeterminate; determinate is ONLY for real staged jobs. The `.hex-march`/`.hex-fill` classes are hand-authored `@layer components` (not JIT utilities) — keep them in `index.css`. Loader/skeleton bands gate on `isLoading` (not just the band) so they never co-render with data.
**NEW OPEN (LOW, in ledgers):** axe-scan the open loading state (a11y.spec only scans loaded pages — folds with the open-dialog-axe rec from Slice 8); determinate-% loaders wire up when the report/MIS/export jobs land (operations phase).

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 8 — ✅ KEYBOARD-NAV / FOCUS-MANAGEMENT (menus + modal dialogs) DONE (2026-06-09; LOCAL/unpushed; Audit Panel CEO + Principal-Engineer + Design-Quality 3/3 PASS).** Closes the carried-OPEN "menu focus-trap / return-focus-on-Escape" item (DATAGRID_STANDARD §19/§20; axe gate 29) — the focus-trap notes folded into the keyboard-nav DEFERRED item are now RESOLVED for all in-scope surfaces.
New shared hook **`apps/web/src/lib/useFocusTrap.ts`** (`useFocusTrap<T>(active, onEscape): RefObject<T>`): on open moves focus into the overlay (first focusable, else the container); traps Tab/Shift+Tab cyclically; Escape→`onEscape` with `stopPropagation` (so nested overlays close innermost-only); on close restores focus to the opener **only when focus would otherwise be lost** (still inside the overlay, or on `<body>`) so a deliberate click elsewhere is never yanked back. Effect deps `[active]` only; `onEscape` read via a latest-ref → no focus re-grab on re-render (stale-closure-safe, no `exhaustive-deps` suppression). Listener is container-scoped (not document). React-18 `RefObject<T>` return.
Wired into the **3 DataGrid popovers** (Export · Columns · ColumnFilterSelect — replaced their bespoke document-level Escape effects) and **8 modal dialogs**, each now carrying `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` + `aria-labelledby` (unique id → title) + Escape-close via the hook: `ConflictDialog` (Escape = no-op must-decide; Tab reaches both buttons → not a 2.1.2 trap), `MasterDataCrud` (clients/products), `VerificationUnitDialog`, `UsersPage` UserDialog, `TemplatesPage` TemplateDialog, `LocationsPage` EditLocationDialog, `CpvPage` RescheduleDialog (role moved overlay→inner panel), `RateManagementPage` ReviseDialog + HistoryDialog. **Nested ConflictDialog is a SIBLING** of the parent's ref'd panel (not a descendant) → the outer trap stays passive while focus is in the inner (Principal-verified, not fragile). +2 Playwright tests (datagrid.spec.ts): Columns menu focus-in→Escape-close→return-focus, and New-Client dialog trap→Escape→return-focus.
**Gates:** `pnpm verify` green (typecheck/lint/format/boundaries/vitest/build); Playwright **10/10 datagrid** (incl. the 2 new focus tests) + **11/11 axe a11y** (0 serious/critical — no ARIA regression); **live-browser confirmed** on /admin/clients (Columns menu: focus→first checkbox, Escape→closed + focus back on the trigger; New dialog: `aria-modal=true`, labelled "New Client", focus on first input, Escape→closed + focus back on +New). FE-only — no API/SDK/SQL/contract surface.
**DELIBERATE CARVE-OUT (CTO):** the `Layout` mobile nav drawer is excluded — dual-mode (`lg:static` in-flow at lg+ / fixed overlay below lg); a trap keyed on `open` would trap desktop keyboard users in the sidebar. → **new OPEN item below.**
**NEW OPEN items (logged in ledgers):** (1) **Layout mobile nav-drawer focus-trap — MEDIUM** (open overlay below lg has no trap / `aria-modal` / Escape; mobile AT users can Tab onto the obscured page; cheap now the hook exists: `useFocusTrap(open && !isWide, close)` on the panel + Escape in the overlay-only branch). (2) **axe open-dialog scan — LOW** (`a11y.spec.ts` only scans closed-state pages; add one axe pass with a dialog open). **DON'T-REGRESS:** a modal's `aria-labelledby` id must match a real, unique element id in the SAME dialog; menu/dialog overlays must mount the hook (focus-in + trap + Escape + return-focus); keep ConflictDialog's Escape a no-op (must-decide).

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 6b — ✅ B-13 EXPORT ROLLOUT to all remaining admin lists DONE (2026-06-07; pattern-identical to the 7-dim-PASS'd reference → CTO-discharged consistency audit).**
Applied the reference export pattern to **verification-units · users · report-templates · locations · rates** (joining clients/products) via 5 parallel specialists, each: a resource `*_EXPORT_COLUMNS: ExportColumn<T>[]` manifest whose `id`s match the FE DataGrid columns + `exportData(query, ex)` that REUSES that module's exact `list()` repo.list args (active/search/columnFilters + resource-specific filters — VU kind, users role, rates clientId/productId/kind, locations pincode, templates templateType) with the export limit/offset rule (`all`→`limit=exportThreshold()`/offset 0 + `assertExportable`) + `export` controller + `GET /export` (perm `data.export`, declared before `/:id`, after `/options`/`/pincodes`/before `/:id/history`) + FE `exportFn` on each page's `<DataGrid>` + an `export` api-test block (CSV/XLSX/cols/400/403/401). SDK gained `.export()` on all 5 (CTO did the shared `client.ts` edits). **`pnpm verify` green; api 241→277 (+36), sdk 69→70 (+1 rollout URL test); all 7 admin `/export` endpoints live-verified 200** (correct per-resource headers: VU `Code,Name,Category,Kind,Billing,…`; users `Username,Name,Role,Reports To,…`; rates `Client,Product,Kind,Verification Unit,Pincode,Area,Rate Type,Rate,…`; locations `Pincode,Area,City,State,Country,…`; templates `Code,Name,Type,…`) + **browser-verified on /admin/rates** (Export menu → All-matching CSV → `GET /rates/export?…&mode=all → 200`). Consistency-checked: every module's route order + `assertExportable`/`exportThreshold` guards identical to the reference. **CARRIED OPEN (unchanged):** ops **cases** export · `selected` mode (row-select) · PDF · ≥10k report-worker job tier (streaming) · cases/locations non-default export-sort indexes (RATCHET). **DON'T-REGRESS:** each resource export REUSES its list query path (never bespoke SQL); manifest `id`s must track the FE DataGrid column ids; `/export` before `/:id`.

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 6 — 🟡 B-13 EXPORT engine + current-view/all-matching (XLSX/CSV) on the clients/products reference DONE (2026-06-07; Audit Panel Security+API-Contract+Performance+Database+Principal+CEO+Design 5 agents/7 dimensions ALL PASS).**
First Administration-first export slice, built to the FROZEN ownership (FROZEN_DECISIONS rows 26/27 + PLATFORM_CAPABILITIES_OWNERSHIP Part 3): **builders are backend-owned at `apps/api/src/platform/export/`** (NOT client-side) and the **DataGrid is the sole export surface**. New `platform/export/`: `format.ts` (`ExportColumn<T>` manifest · RFC-4180 `toCsv` + **CWE-1236 formula-injection** `escapeCsvCell` · `toXlsx` via **exceljs**, lazy-imported · `selectColumns` for visible `cols` · Date→ISO in the cell formatter since pg timestamptz arrives as Date) + `index.ts` (`resolveExport` [400 BAD_EXPORT_FORMAT/MODE], `assertExportable` [**413 EXPORT_TOO_LARGE** at `totalCount ≥ EXPORT_JOB_THRESHOLD=10000`], `writeExport` [streams + @crm2/logger export-audit line]). Per resource: `exportData(query, ex)` REUSES the list `resolvePage`/`resolveFilters`/`repo.list` (mode `current`=exact page · `all`=no page LIMIT, capped at threshold/offset 0) + a thin `GET /:resource/export` route (perm **`data.export`**, declared BEFORE `/:id`). Shared `modules/shared/masterDataExport.ts` manifest (clients+products byte-identical). New `@crm2/access` `DATA_EXPORT` (default-deny; granted SA/MGR/TL/BE, excluded FIELD_AGENT/KYC_VERIFIER) + `@crm2/config` `EXPORT_JOB_THRESHOLD`. SDK: `export.ts` (`ExportRequest`/`exportQueryToParams` — `all` drops page/limit) + `reqBlob` transport + `clients/products.export()` (purely **ADDITIVE**, never-break-mobile holds — web-only). Web: `apiBlob` (401-refresh-aware blob GET) in `lib/sdk.ts` + DataGrid `exportFn?` prop + toolbar **Export menu** (Current view / All matching × XLSX/CSV; mirrors the Columns-menu tokens/a11y; `Exporting…` busy state + `role=alert` EXPORT_TOO_LARGE banner); `MasterDataCrud` wires it. **`pnpm verify` green; api 223→241 (+18), sdk 63→69 (+6); Playwright 64→65 (+download e2e at Laptop band); live dev API verified** (CSV current + XLSX `all` [PK-magic] + `cols` selection + 400 bad-format + 403 no-perm + ISO dates) + **browser-verified** (menu renders 4 items/2 groups; click → `GET /clients/export?…&format=csv&mode=all&cols=… → 200`). **CARRIED OPEN / RATCHETS (Audit):** (1) `selected` mode DEFERRED → needs row-select (separate item); PDF DEFERRED (optional); (2) **≥10k report-worker job tier DEFERRED** — streaming XLSX/CSV builders MANDATORY there (buffered exceljs blows memory at 100k+); (3) when `all`-export rolls to **locations[157k]/cases**, non-default export sort cols need `(col,id)` indexes or restrict to indexed sorts (default-sort + trgm search already indexed 0020/0021); (4) at row-scoped tables (cases), the SCOPED total must drive `assertExportable` (auto-inherits via `repo.list` reuse) so a 413 can't leak out-of-scope row existence. **ROLLOUT TODO (this task, Administration-first): VU · users · report-templates · locations · rates** (+ then ops cases). **DON'T-REGRESS:** export builders stay backend-owned in `platform/export/`; every new resource export REUSES its list query path (never bespoke SQL); `cols` only ever filters a hardcoded `ExportColumn[]` manifest by id (never reaches SQL); add new FK-scoped tables' scope to the reused list query, not the export.

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 4 — ✅ B-4 Excel-style header multi-select (§7) DONE (2026-06-06; Audit Panel Security+DB+Performance+CEO+Principal+API/Contract+Design 7/7 PASS).**
Extends the column-filter contract from single→multi-value: `AppliedFilter` now `{field,column,op:'ilike'|'eq'|'in',values:string[]}`; `resolveFilters`
parses comma-separated enum (keeps only filterMap-allowed, de-duped → `in` if >1 else `eq`); NEW `filterClauses(filters,params)` centralizes
WHERE-building (`in`→`${col} = ANY($n)` array-bound · `ilike`→`${col} ILIKE $n` · `eq`→`${col} = $n`) — clients/products/VU repos refactored to
it (DRY; clients/products text behavior byte-identical). Grid: `DataGridColumn.filterOptions?:{value,label}[]` → header filter renders an
Excel-style multi-select `ColumnFilterSelect` (button "All"/"N selected" + checkbox panel + click-outside backdrop + Escape) committing
comma-joined values to `f_<id>`. VU `kind` is the reference (all 3 `KINDS`) — **the old toolbar kind `<select>` (only 2 of 3 kinds → DESK_DOCUMENT
was silently unfilterable) REMOVED**, so this is defect-closing (CEO-noted). **Injection-safe** incl. the ANY path (column always a filterMap literal;
values bound as a typed array). `AppliedFilter` shape change is server-INTERNAL (no SDK/wire change; wire still `?f_<id>=v1,v2`). `pnpm verify`
green; api 207→210 (+filterClauses unit, +enum-multi unit, +VU f_kind api); Playwright 64 (+§7: open→check→URL `f_kind=FIELD_VISIT`→reload "1
selected"→uncheck clears); browser-verified. **DON'T-REGRESS:** filter `column` only ever from filterMap; ANY binds the array param (never build an
IN-list string). Focus-trap on the dropdown folds into the keyboard-nav OPEN.

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 3b — ✅ B-3 grid per-column filter UI DONE (2026-06-06, FE consumer; Audit Panel CEO+Principal+Design 3/3 PASS) → B-3 now FIXED end-to-end.**
`DataGridColumn.filterable?:boolean`; the grid reads each filterable column's `f_<id>` URL key, merges into the request `filters` (SDK emits
`?f_<id>=v` to the contract from 3a), keys the react-query. A per-column filter row in `<thead>` (below the header, mapped over `visibleColumns`
so it stays 1:1 with the visibility-aware headers) renders a debounced `ColumnFilterInput` (local draft → commits to URL after 300ms → re-seeds
on external URL change — mirrors the global-search idiom). MasterDataCrud marks code+name filterable → clients+products grids get column filters.
`.input` token + `normal-case` (filter th not uppercased), `aria-label="Filter <col>"`, filter row inside the `overflow-x-auto` wrapper (no page
overflow). `pnpm verify` green; Playwright 63 (+1: fill→URL `f_code=hd`→reload re-seeds→clear removes param); browser-verified (server
`f_code=hd`→only HDFC; filter inputs render under CODE+NAME aligned). **Rollout to other lists = add `filterMap` (service) + `filterable` (column def) per page** — next as lists need it.

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 3a — 🟡 B-3 server-side column-filter CONTRACT DONE (2026-06-06, backend-only; Audit Panel Security+DB+Performance+CEO+Principal+API/Contract 6/6 PASS).**
Generic per-column filtering on the universal list contract, mirroring the proven `sortMap` whitelist: `platform/pagination.ts` gains
`FilterField` + `PageSpec.filterMap` (apiField→{column, kind:'text'|'enum', values?}) + `AppliedFilter` + `resolveFilters()` (parses request
`f_<apiField>` params; unknown fields + out-of-set enum values DROPPED; text→ILIKE, enum→eq). clients+products services declare `filterMap`
(code/name text), call resolveFilters, pass `columnFilters` to the repo, echo `f_<field>` into the envelope `filters`; repos append
`${f.column} ILIKE|= $n` with the VALUE bound as a param. **Injection-safe BY CONSTRUCTION** (audit-confirmed + tested): `f.column` is only ever
a hardcoded `filterMap` literal — resolveFilters validates the request field is a filterMap KEY and copies the def's column; no request string
ever reaches SQL text. Filters apply to BOTH count + items (shared where/params), AND-combined (§8). Purely ADDITIVE (`Paginated.filters` already
`Record<string,unknown>`; `pageQueryToParams` already serializes `filters` → `?f_code=x` works via the SDK today); no SDK/contract change,
never-break-mobile holds. `pnpm verify` green; api 200→207 (+5 `resolveFilters` unit covering whitelist/enum/injection, +2 clients api). **NEXT
sub-slice: the grid per-column filter UI (header inputs, `f_<id>` URL keys) consuming this.** **RATCHET (Performance):** when this contract rolls
to large tables (cases/locations), each filterable text column needs a trigram GIN index (precedent: migrations 0020/0021).

**ADVANCED DATAGRID Slice 2 — ✅ B-6 Column visibility DONE (2026-06-06, FE-only, Audit Panel CEO+Principal+Design 3/3 PASS).**
Toolbar "Columns" menu on the universal `DataGrid` (button + panel + click-outside backdrop + Escape); hidden column ids persist in the
`cols` URL key (comma-separated; reuses the grid's existing URL-state convention — §12; URL-state interim before the saved-views backend
store §10). New optional `hideable?: boolean` on `DataGridColumn` (default true; false = pinned always-visible). TanStack `columnVisibility`
wired into table state; skeleton rows + empty/error colSpan now track `visibleColumns`. **Guards (belt-and-suspenders):** the menu cannot
hide the last visible column, AND a tampered/stale URL that would hide every column falls back to all-visible (never a blank table). All 7
migrated lists inherit it with ZERO per-page edits. `pnpm verify` green; Playwright 62 passed (+1: toggle→header removed + URL `cols=`→reload
persists→re-show clears); browser-verified menu renders all 7 clients columns token-styled. **CARRIED OPEN:** menu has no focus-trap /
return-focus-on-Escape (LOW; not an axe serious/critical → gate 29 green) — folds into the DATAGRID_STANDARD §2 **keyboard-nav** DEFERRED item.

**ROLLOUT-TAIL Slice 1B — ✅ B-22 lightweight options endpoints DONE (2026-06-06, Audit Panel CEO+Principal+Security+API/Contract+Performance+Design 6/6 PASS).**
New unpaginated USABLE `/options` feeds so dropdowns never silently truncate (the old feeders did `?active=true&limit=200`+`.items`):
`GET /api/v2/{clients,products,verification-units}/options` → `Option {id,code,name}` (VU also returns `kind` via `VerificationUnitOption`
since rate-management filters units by kind); `GET /api/v2/users/options` → `UserOption {id,username,name,role}` (the reports-to picker).
Per module: repository.options() (zero-input raw SELECT, hardcoded ORDER BY — no injection surface) + service passthrough + controller +
route registered BEFORE `/:id` (param-capture trap); same RBAC as the sibling list (MASTERDATA_VIEW / USER_VIEW). SDK: new `options.ts`,
`UserOption` (users.ts), `VerificationUnitOption` (verificationUnit.ts), 4 client methods + tests (call-count 62→66 + focused URL test).
FE: 9 feeder call sites in CaseCreate/CPV/RateMgmt/UsersPage switched (envelope→flat-array flipped in lockstep; unused full-type imports
dropped). `pnpm verify` green (api 200 [+8] · sdk green · web build); browser-verified on /cases/new (Client+Product dropdowns populate;
VU options return id/code/name/kind live). **Scope beyond literal B-22 (clients/products/VU): added `users.options()` (same truncation bug
class) + VU `kind` (real RateMgmt consumer) — Audit confirmed disciplined, not creep. CARRIED OPEN (NEW):** (1) RateMgmt
`locations?pincode=&limit=200` feeder LEFT as-is (bounded-per-pincode, different shape) — track if a pincode ever exceeds ~200 locations;
(2) **RATCHET (Performance):** `users/options` is unpaginated — if a deployment ever reaches ~thousands of users, switch the reports-to
picker to server-side typeahead (not needed at current scale).

**ROLLOUT-TAIL Slice 1A — ✅ cases-growth index ratchet DONE (`0021_cases_growth_indexes.sql`, 2026-06-06, Audit Panel CEO+Principal+DB+Performance 4/4 PASS).**
cases is the one unbounded operational table; the DataGrid list now has matching indexes for all three access paths:
`idx_cases_created_at (created_at DESC, id DESC)` = default sort first-page-off-index; `idx_cases_product (product_id)`
= the products JOIN (client side already had `idx_cases_client`); `idx_cases_case_number_trgm` + `idx_applicants_name_trgm`
(gin trgm) = the leading-wildcard `ILIKE '%term%'` global search (pre-existing `idx_applicants_name`=`lower(name)` is
equality-only). Triple-write (file + dev `crm2_dev`@54329 + test `crm2_test`@5433, idempotent); full chain 0001→0021
clean on a fresh DB twice. **Dispositions (Audit-confirmed):** `count(*) OVER()` → **WONTFIX** (the list deliberately
runs a separate LEAN count joining only cases+primary-applicant, avoiding the per-row applicant/task correlated
subqueries — windowing would force them into the count); LATERAL/grouped counts → **WONTFIX** (those subqueries are
index-backed by `idx_applicants_case`+`idx_case_tasks_case` and page-bounded ≤500); **small-table sort indexes
(users/VU/templates) → RATCHET/defer-by-design** (planner won't choose an index over seq-scan+in-memory-sort at
≤few-hundred rows → pure write overhead; revisit at GA if any table exceeds ~5k rows). EXPLAIN-at-scale not locally
provable (tiny dev/test cases tables); index defs provably match the access paths (proactive pre-growth ratchet).

## Section D — BUILD BLOCKERS

**Current status: NONE.** CRM2 can continue building safely (see the 2026-06-05 freeze
compliance audit, F-1). If a blocker appears, record here: issue · severity · owner · resolution
plan — and do not start dependent work until resolved.

---

## Section E — RATCHET items (good enough today; must improve gradually)

Floors are enforced now and **only ratchet up** (never lowered without CTO sign-off —
`TECH_DEBT_POLICY.md`).

| ID | Metric | Current (enforced floor) | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-1 | api-v2 line/stmt coverage | 85.7% (floor 85) | 90% | RATCHET |
| E-2 | api-v2 branch coverage | 59.4% (floor 58) | 85% | RATCHET |
| E-3 | sdk branch coverage | 68.9% (floor 65) | 85% | RATCHET |
| E-4 | logger funcs/branch coverage | 80% (floor 80) | 90% | RATCHET |
| E-5 | axe a11y gate severity (gate 29) | gates `serious` + `critical` (0 violations) | hold | ✅ FIXED |

Raise a module's floor when its coverage rises so it cannot regress. **E-5 → FIXED 2026-06-06** (owner-signed-off):
darkened 4 light tokens (`--muted-foreground` 47→43% [4.96:1], `--st-in-progress` 53→45%, `--st-approved` 29→25%,
`--st-revisit` 42→35%) to ≥4.5:1 + `aria-disabled` on the inactive Operations nav (WCAG 1.4.3 exemption); a11y
`GATED_IMPACTS` now gates `serious`+`critical` (0 violations). Dark mode audited → already AA by computation
(amendment recorded in `docs/COLOR_SYSTEM_FREEZE.md`).

---

## Section F — AUDIT HISTORY (never delete findings)

Each finding is marked OPEN · FIXED · DEFERRED · WONTFIX.

### F-1 · Freeze Compliance Audit — 2026-06-05
- **Scope:** frozen-vs-implemented across workspace, architecture, data model, API, data access,
  tooling, logger, design, governance, machine enforcement.
- **Result:** GREEN — build may continue; **0 blockers**.
- **Findings:**
  - Coverage gate non-functional → **FIXED** (A-1, `642c362`).
  - DataGrid / pagination / search-filter / loading-UX not built → **DEFERRED** (Section B).
  - 6 pre-freeze bespoke tables → **DEFERRED/RETROFIT** (Section C).
  - api-v2 / sdk coverage below 90/85 → **RATCHET** (Section E).
  - OpenAPI / SDK-drift / Playwright pending → **DEFERRED** (B-10/11/12).
  - Migration number gap `0005` (removed users mig; forward-only) → **WONTFIX** (cosmetic; harness
    sorts by filename, not a violation).
- **Evidence:** the audit report (session 2026-06-05); commits `642c362` (coverage), `9bce9b5`
  (governance), `7970a39`/`b23c61d` (DataGrid + pagination freezes).

### F-2 · State + Freeze-Compliance Audit — 2026-06-05
- **Scope:** shipped code vs frozen decisions + `pnpm verify`; Rate-Management doc drift; migration
  chain 0001→0016 on a fresh DB; FROZEN_DECISIONS / COMPLIANCE_GAPS vs reality.
- **Result:** code GREEN (verify exit 0; migration chain clean; no live refs to dropped rate tables;
  frozen-decision conformance 5/5). Documentation/governance drift found (no code defects).
- **Findings:**
  - `pnpm verify` green · migration chain coherent · no dead refs to `rate_type_eligibility`/
    `service_zone_rules` · repo pattern / no-Prisma / /api/v2 / 6 pkgs all conform → **PASS**.
  - **Rate-Management doc drift** — ADR-0016 + `RATE_MANAGEMENT_FREEZE.md` + FROZEN #29 + B-21 +
    `PROJECT_INDEX`/`BUILD_GATE_REGISTRY_LOCK` describe the OLD 4-table model (eligibility + SZR +
    trigger) but the shipped model is the FLAT one-table `rates` (migs 0013/0014 dropped those
    tables). → ✅ **FIXED (2026-06-05, same session)**: wrote superseding **ADR-0018** (flat model) +
    status-banner on ADR-0016/RATE_MANAGEMENT_FREEZE + marked FROZEN #29 SUPERSEDED→ADR-0018 + added
    flat-model FROZEN #31 + moved B-21 to FIXED + corrected PROJECT_INDEX / BUILD_GATE_REGISTRY_LOCK /
    MASTER_MEMORY §8 rate row.
  - **B-15 Authentication** registry row was stale (said "deferred / x-test-auth") though auth shipped
    (ADR-0014). → ✅ **FIXED (2026-06-05)** — B-15 moved to FIXED.
  - `docs/adr/README.md` index table was missing ADR-0014/0015/0016 → **FIXED** this session (added
    0014–0018 rows).
  - Stale ADR-range/decision-count pointers across rule/kickoff/governance docs + FREEZE_LOCK_REPORT
    missing 3 enforcement rows + MANAGEMENT_LIST_STANDARD missing the Effective-From column note →
    ✅ **FIXED (2026-06-05 doc-consistency sweep)**.
- **Evidence:** audit report (session 2026-06-05, 3 parallel specialists) + the doc-consistency sweep;
  commits `11f1970`, `f59715f`, and the docs-reconciliation commit.

### F-3 · Responsive-Design Implementation Review — 2026-06-05 (freeze: ADR-0008/0013 umbrella, FROZEN #32)
- **Scope:** every shipped web screen vs the new Responsive-First standard (`docs/RESPONSIVE_DESIGN_STANDARD.md`),
  by parallel code audit + live browser at 320/768/1024/1440.
- **Verdict:** 🔴 the app is **desktop-only today — not usable below ~1024px**. Two systemic defects + a
  table-strategy gap. (No code defects in logic; this is a UI-responsiveness gap → retrofit cohort **C-9**.)
- **Browser evidence (320px, /admin/clients):** horizontal overflow **93px**; sidebar **240px** (75% of a
  320px viewport) with **no hamburger/drawer**; table content 743px clipped (wrapper is `overflow-hidden`).
- **CRITICAL findings:**
  - **C1 — fixed always-visible sidebar, no mobile nav** (`components/Layout.tsx:38` `aside w-60 shrink-0`;
    no `Sheet`/`Drawer`/hamburger anywhere). #1 blocker — blocks every screen. (`main` already has `min-w-0`.)
  - **C2 — 9 wide tables wrapped in `overflow-hidden`** (clips columns, no scroll): MasterDataCrud
    (Clients/Products), CPV, Locations, VerificationUnits, Templates, Users, Cases list, CaseCreate, CaseDetail.
  - **C3 — 3 bare tables with no scroll wrapper** (CPV #2 `:308`, CaseCreate dedupe `:206`, CaseDetail tasks `:132`).
  - **C4 — widest tables need card/list on mobile**: Rate Mgmt (13 cols), Access Control matrix, Case Detail.
- **MAJOR:** only 2/15 tables use `overflow-x-auto`; ubiquitous `whitespace-nowrap` forces width; no top app-bar
  for mobile nav once the sidebar hides; dialog panels lack `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` (tall forms clip).
- **Already OK:** Login (fully responsive); System (content responsive, blocked only by the shell). Filter rows
  are `flex flex-wrap` (OK); meta grids are mostly mobile-up already.
- **Status → DEFERRED (retrofit C-9)**; fix order: (1) sidebar→drawer + mobile top-bar, (2) flip 9
  `overflow-hidden`→`overflow-x-auto` + wrap 3 bare tables, (3) card/list for the wide tables (folds into the
  DataGrid build), (4) dialog `max-h`/scroll, (5) stat-card `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`.
- **Evidence:** parallel code-audit agent + live preview viewport test (this session).
- **UPDATE 2026-06-05 → MOSTLY FIXED (steps 1,2,4 done; owner directive "works on any device"):**
  Shell reworked to **one hamburger-driven sidebar at every breakpoint** (`Layout.tsx`): top bar with hamburger
  on all screens; sidebar **pushes** content at `lg+` (in-flow, `lg:static`, starts open) and **overlays** with
  backdrop below `lg` (starts closed, closes on nav). 10 table wrappers → `overflow-x-auto`; 5 dialog panels →
  `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto`; Locations + CPV toolbars full-width-on-mobile. **Verified live** at 320/768/
  1024/1440: page horizontal-overflow = 0 everywhere; 13-col Rate table scrolls inside its card; dialog scrolls
  within a 560px-tall viewport; desktop toggle pushes (content left 240↔0); phone toggle overlays. CEO audit:
  APPROVE (token-only colors, a11y labels, surgical, no scope creep). `pnpm verify` web gates green
  (typecheck/lint/format/build). **STILL OPEN (next wave):** step (3) true table→card mobile views (interim
  `overflow-x-auto` satisfies the mandatory minimum); step (5) any residual non-responsive stat grids
  (e.g. pre-existing `TemplatesPage` bare `grid-cols-2`); the standard's per-page **Playwright** 320/768/1024/
  1440 specs (harness not yet stood up — CI gates 49–50 still stubbed). C-9 stays OPEN until those land.
- **UPDATE 2026-06-06 → NEXT-WAVE FIXED (steps 3 + 5 + Playwright harness; commits `63e6681` + `8dc57b8`,
  two CEO audits APPROVE):** all three remaining items landed.
  - **(3) table→card** via a reversible CSS utility `.rtable` (`apps/web/src/index.css`): below `md`
    (<768px) each row collapses into a stacked card, each `<td>` shows its column name through a `data-label`
    `::before`; `td[colspan]` state/expand rows auto-render full-width; opt-out via `data-label=""`. Interim
    mechanism, **removed when the Universal DataGrid (B-1/C-8) lands** (it then owns the responsive column
    strategy). Applied to the 8 flat list pages first (MasterDataCrud clients/products, users, locations,
    verification_units, templates, rate_management 13 cols, cases), then — on owner cross-check ("cpv page not
    using this card, cross check all pages first", commit `defa3c4`) — to **every remaining record-list table**:
    CPV (link + nested unit sub-table), Case Detail (applicants + tasks), Case Create (dedupe + unit picker),
    Rate Mgmt history sub-table. **Sole card-exemption = Access Control role×perm matrix** (columns ARE the
    roles); System has no list. **🔑 `.rtable` made NEST-SAFE** by switching to the CHILD combinator
    (`table.rtable > tbody > tr > td`) so an outer table never leaks into a nested table inside an expand/colspan
    row — each cards independently (verified live on CPV at 375px).
  - **(5) residual stat grids** fixed: bare `grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` in MasterDataCrud,
    UsersPage, TemplatesPage (stat cards + dialog field-pairs). Repo-wide grep = **0 bare `grid-cols-N`** in
    `apps/web/src`.
  - **Playwright harness STOOD UP** (`apps/web/playwright.config.ts` + `e2e/`): `setup` project logs in
    once → storageState; 4 viewport projects render at 375/768/1280/1440 (band minimums 320/768/1024/1440);
    `viewport.spec` asserts **no horizontal overflow + reachable nav trigger + primary action** on all 11 pages,
    **+ the mobile card transform (`td` `display:flex`)** on the 8 list pages; `login.spec` covers the unauth
    page. `webServer` boots `pnpm dev` (vite proxy `/api`→:4000). **49/49 green vs the live stack.** Script
    `pnpm --filter @crm2/web test:e2e`; kept OUT of `pnpm verify`/turbo `test` (vitest-only) — `vitest.config`
    scopes vitest to `src/**` so it never collects the Playwright specs.
  - **CI gates 49–50 now have a real harness** (no longer stubbed); CI activation = add the `test:e2e` step
    against a booted stack (web + api + DB).
    DON'T-REGRESS: any new list page ships with `.rtable` + data-labels and a `card:true` row in `viewport.spec`.
- **UPDATE 2026-06-06 (cont.) → A11Y GATE 29 + CI E2E JOB DONE (commit `f91a414`, CEO PASS):**
  - **axe a11y (gate 29)** `apps/web/e2e/a11y.spec.ts` — WCAG 2.0/2.1 A+AA on every page (once at the
    Laptop band; a11y is viewport-independent). **Gates CRITICAL** (0 after the fix); **reports SERIOUS** via a
    test annotation (not gated). Fixed the critical `select-name` findings = `aria-label` on the always-visible
    toolbar filter selects (MasterDataCrud/Cases/VU/Users/Templates) + CPV's 3 selects (dialog selects already
    have wrapping `<label>` — untouched). **Location Management excluded** from axe (157k-row catalog = analysis
    too slow/flaky; same components covered elsewhere; still in viewport.spec).
  - **Harness self-booting:** `playwright.config` webServer is now `[API, web]` — boots `pnpm --filter @crm2/api
    dev` (health `/api/v2/system/health` 401=ready) + web; `reuseExistingServer:!CI` (local reuses a running
    stack, CI boots fresh — API needs only `DATABASE_URL`, other env defaulted). Card assertion made
    **data-tolerant** (`cells.count()>0`) so a fresh empty CI DB passes (overflow/nav/primary still always assert).
  - **CI e2e job** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): dedicated `e2e` job `needs: build`, postgres:17, applies all
    migrations (seeds dev admin via 0009 → login works), installs the browser, runs `test:e2e`, uploads the html
    report. **Proven locally end-to-end** (fresh DB → migrate → API boots → admin/admin123 → 200 SUPER_ADMIN).
  - **C-9 now substantially CLOSED.** New tracked **RATCHET E-5** (below): serious `color-contrast` a11y on the
    FROZEN design tokens — raise `GATED_IMPACTS` to include `'serious'` once a token-contrast remediation lands
    (needs design sign-off vs COLOR_SYSTEM_FREEZE). Optional tablet "condensed" tier remains a nice-to-have.

### C-10 · OCC / editing retrofit — progress (ADR-0019, FROZEN #33)
- **2026-06-05 → slice 0 + slice 1 (Users) DONE** (commit `21cf2d6`, CEO audit APPROVE):
  - **Slice 0 (platform, once):** migration `0017` = generic **immutable `audit_log`** (trigger blocks
    UPDATE/DELETE) + `version integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1` on `clients`/`products`/`locations`/`users`/
    `report_templates` (`verification_units` already had one). `platform/occ.ts` `requireVersion()` →
    400 VERSION_REQUIRED; `platform/audit.ts` `appendAudit()` (structural query-fn param, never imports
    `db.ts` — boundary-clean); `STALE_UPDATE`/`VERSION_REQUIRED` codes; error middleware surfaces
    `{ current }` on 409.
  - **Slice 1 (Users = reference vertical every later module copies):** guarded UPDATE
    `… version=version+1 … WHERE id=$id AND version=$expected RETURNING`; 0 rows → 404 vs 409
    `STALE_UPDATE(current)`; activate/deactivate guarded; create/update/(de)activate each append ONE
    audit row in the SAME tx. SDK `User.version` + versioned update/activate/deactivate (version OUT of
    the zod schema → missing = VERSION_REQUIRED, not VALIDATION). FE reusable `ConflictDialog` (reload &
    re-apply / discard, no silent overwrite); `ApiError` carries body. `pnpm verify` green (117 tests incl.
    OCC contract); live preview verified conflict + reload-&-re-apply recovery.
- **2026-06-05 → slice 2 (clients + products) DONE** (commit `115b2f9`, CEO audit APPROVE): faithful
  mirror of the Users vertical on both modules (guarded update/setActive + in-tx audit, requireVersion,
  404-vs-409, SDK `Client/Product.version` + versioned mutators) + the **shared `MasterDataCrud` FE**
  (edit dialog + toggle send version, reusable `ConflictDialog` on 409 — covers clients AND products).
  `pnpm verify` green (125 api + 62 sdk); live preview verified conflict + reload-&-re-apply on
  `/admin/clients`. (int-PK divergence from Users: tests truncate `audit_log` too, since RESTART
  IDENTITY reuses `entity_id`.)
- **2026-06-05 → slice 3 (verification_units) DONE** (commit `64c460a`, CEO audit APPROVE): VU already had
  a `version` column that bumped but was UNENFORCED — this slice **enforces the guard** (`WHERE id=$1 AND
  version=$22`, param numbering verified) + adds in-tx audit + FE conflict (VerificationUnitDialog + page
  toggle). service does `requireVersion(patch)` before the merge-revalidate (existing.version stripped by
  zod). `pnpm verify` green (129 api + 62 sdk); live preview verified conflict + reload-&-re-apply on
  `/admin/verification-units`.
- **2026-06-05 → slice 4 (CPV mapping) DONE** (commit `abe8f31`, CEO audit APPROVE): toggle-only
  client_products + cpv-units. Migration `0018` adds `version` (only — these tables never had
  created_by/updated_by; actor captured in audit_log). Guarded setActive on both sub-repos (404 vs 409),
  create/(de)activate audited in-tx. **List SELECTs are hand-written (not the COLS constant) — fixed both
  to return `version`** (the toggle needs it) + regression assertions. FE CpvPage: both toggles
  (client-product + unit) send version → ConflictDialog. `pnpm verify` green (137 api + 62 sdk); live
  client-product toggle conflict verified on `/admin/cpv`. **Known asymmetry (tracked, non-defect):** the 2
  CPV tables are the only master tables without `updated_by` (actor lives in audit_log).
- **2026-06-05 → slice 5 (rates) DONE** (commit `2306749`, CEO audit APPROVE): rates is effective-dated
  (ADR-0018) and had NO version col (0013 flatten dropped it). Migration `0019` adds `version`. updateAmount
  + setActive guarded (404 vs 409); **revise** = OCC version-check throws `stale(cur)` BEFORE any mutation
  (rollback-safe), then end-dates current (version+1) + inserts new dated row — end-date-first preserves the
  `rates_no_overlap` GiST constraint. Keeps `rate_history` (domain audit); **audit_log untouched** (§2:
  effective-dated domains keep domain history). Hand-written list SELECT carries `r.version`. FE: rate toggle
  + ReviseForm → ConflictDialog. `pnpm verify` green (142 api + 62 sdk); live toggle conflict verified.
- **2026-06-05 → slice 6 (locations + report_templates) DONE** (commit `96d065f`, CEO audit APPROVE): both
  mirror the clients reference (version cols already existed from 0017 — no migration); guarded update/setActive
  + in-tx audit_log; both `list()` use the shared SELECT_COLS constant (trap cleared); FE EditLocationDialog +
  TemplateDialog + both toggles → ConflictDialog. `pnpm verify` green (150 api + 62 sdk); live location toggle
  conflict verified.
- **✅ 2026-06-05 → C-10 ADMINISTRATION COMPLETE (owner: "focus on admin only").** All 8 editable
  administration surfaces are OCC-guarded + audited + have FE conflict dialogs: **users · clients · products ·
  verification_units · CPV (client_products + cpv-units) · rates · locations · report_templates**. (Read-only
  admin surfaces — access-control matrix, system health, rate_types lookup — have no edits, so OCC is N/A.)
  Platform: migrations 0017/0018/0019, generic immutable `audit_log` (+ rates keeps `rate_history`),
  `platform/occ.requireVersion`, `platform/audit.appendAudit`, reusable FE `ConflictDialog`. Every slice
  CEO-APPROVED + live-verified + pushed (origin/main `f82c06f`).
- **DEFERRED (operations, NOT admin — out of current scope):** `cases`/`case_tasks` OCC (cases immutable
  post-create; case_tasks = assign/unassign mutations; would need a `version` column on case_tasks + guarding
  the assign/unassign paths + audit). Pick up when operations work resumes. **Also still deferred:** the §1
  production hardening on `audit_log` (hash-chain + monthly partition + off-DB copy). C-10 stays OPEN for
  these two items, but the **admin retrofit it was created for is DONE.**

## Section G — Commission ↔ Rate cross-audit (2026-06-18)

Source: [`docs/engineering/COMMISSION_RATE_CROSS_AUDIT_2026-06-18.md`](engineering/COMMISSION_RATE_CROSS_AUDIT_2026-06-18.md)
(5 parallel read-only auditors, areas A–E). Governed by ADR-0036 (commission model) + ADR-0018 (flat
rates). **No code changed — audit only.** All findings below carry a disposition; none are blockers to
the *audit*, but G-1 gates the *rebuild* on an owner decision (+ superseding ADR if amount-varies).

**OWNER DECISIONS LOCKED 2026-06-18:** commission model = **(i) amount-varies, fully decoupled from
the client rate_type** (executive's own pincode/area mapping; OGL-for-client can be LOCAL-for-executive)
→ supersedes ADR-0036, needs **ADR-0046**. Dimensions = executive + location + client + product/VU +
**TAT band**. `bill_count` = multiplier → **FIX** (G-2). Pipeline tab = **REMOVE entirely** (G-3).
**SEQUENCE:** build the **TAT band system first** (G-7), then the full commission rebuild. See the
audit doc's "Decisions LOCKED" section.

**✅ BUILT & GATE-VERIFIED 2026-06-19 (ADR-0046, branch `worktree-feat-commission-rebuild`, NOT yet
deployed).** TAT (ADR-0044) shipped first; this rebuild then decoupled commission from the client rate
(`COMMISSION_LATERAL` rewritten: location + client + product/VU + completed-in-TAT-band cascade, no
`rate_type` join; point-in-time as-of `COALESCE(ct.completed_at, now())` per ADR-0046 §4 — read-derived,
no persisted ledger), added the dimensions to `commission_rates` (mig **0079**, generalized no-overlap
EXCLUDE), fixed the `bill_count` rollup (+`billable_units`), added the per-pincode/area + completed-in-band
billing breakdown, removed the pipeline money surface, and added the cascading-picker commission form +
breakdown panels. Resolutions: **G-1 ✅ FIXED**, **G-2 ✅ FIXED**, **G-3 ✅ FIXED**, **G-7 ✅ FIXED**
(TAT shipped + consumed). Acceptance §E proven by integration test (T1 ₹50 @ L1 vs T2 ₹90 @ L2, total
₹140; bill_count ×; by-location/by-band breakdown). Full `pnpm verify` GREEN (63 api + 25 sdk test files,
coverage met, build clean). **Live browser-verify OUTSTANDING** — preview MCP unavailable this session;
verify on the prod-dev box post-deploy or via a local preview. New discovery → **G-8** below.

### G-1 · Commission has no pincode/area dimension — ✅ FIXED (ADR-0046, 2026-06-19)
- **Severity:** HIGH (the requested capability). **Finding:** `commission_rates` is keyed
  `(user_id, rate_type, client_id, time)` with no location term; `COMMISSION_LATERAL`
  (`laterals.ts:35-42`) has no location operand. Commission varies by location only *transitively*
  via the location-resolved `rt.rate_type` — so two completed tasks with the **same** `rate_type` in
  **different** pincodes/areas earn the **same** commission (proven §E: ₹50 vs ₹50).
- **Disposition:** DEFERRED pending owner decision §1 (amount-varies → model (i)/(iii) → **supersedes
  ADR-0036, needs ADR-0046**; reporting-only → model (ii) → no supersession). Not a defect against
  ADR-0036 (which deliberately excludes location); it is a scope/requirement change.

### G-2 · Billing rollup ignores `case_tasks.bill_count` — ✅ FIXED (ADR-0046, 2026-06-19)
- **Severity:** HIGH (location-independent amount/count correctness). **Finding:** `bill_count`
  (`0011_task_assignment.sql:11`, default 1, per-task editable in the SDK) is never read by the
  rollup or laterals — a `bill_count=3` task contributes `bill_amount×1` and counts as 1. If it is a
  billable-units multiplier (name + editability imply so), `bill_total` should be
  `SUM(rt.bill_amount * ct.bill_count)` and the count may need weighting.
- **Disposition:** DEFERRED pending owner confirmation of intent (Decisions §2). If confirmed a bug →
  FIXED in the rebuild; if vestigial/always-1 → WONTFIX with rationale. **Must not be silently dropped.**

### G-3 · "Commissionable" tab surfaces ₹ in the pipeline (operational view) — ✅ FIXED (ADR-0046, 2026-06-19)
- **Severity:** LOW (UX/scope; **not** a security hole). **Finding:** `PipelinePage.tsx` shows
  bill/commission columns + a Commissionable bucket (gated `billing.view` on the FE). The **server is
  already safe** — it nulls amounts and ignores `commissionable=1` for non-`billing.view` actors
  (proven by `tasks.api.test.ts:734-767`). Pure FE-surface concern.
- **Disposition:** DEFERRED pending owner decision §5 (remove from pipeline; confine money to the
  `billing.view` Billing page). Clean ~6-edit FE-only removal; no backend/security change.

### G-4 · MIS Layout `RATE_AMOUNT`/`COMMISSION_AMOUNT` column types ungated at generation — ✅ FIXED (ADR-0049, MIS build, 2026-06-19)
- **Severity:** LOW (no live leak today). **Finding:** these were bindable column *types* in the
  report-layout catalog (`packages/sdk/src/reportLayouts.ts:36-37`) with no generation endpoint to turn
  them into money.
- **Disposition:** FIXED by the MIS generation/export build (ADR-0049, `docs/specs/2026-06-19-mis-page-design.md`).
  The `mis` service enforces **per-column `billing.view` gating at BOTH `/rows` and `/export`**
  (`apps/api/src/modules/mis/service.ts` `filterColumns`): when the actor lacks `billing.view` (and isn't
  grants_all), `RATE_AMOUNT`/`COMMISSION_AMOUNT` columns are dropped **server-side** from the resolved
  set, the SQL, and the `ExportColumn[]` manifest (the laterals are omitted entirely). **Proven** by
  `mis.api.test.ts` (a non-`billing.view` actor's `columns` exclude the money columns and rows carry no
  money keys — structural absence, not nulling) + an independent security review (APPROVE). Full
  `pnpm verify` green. (Live prod browser-verify pending deploy.)

### G-5 · Billing SUMs do not normalize currency — 🟢 RATCHET (latent; all-INR today)
- **Severity:** LOW. **Finding:** `SUM(bill_amount)`/`SUM(commission_amount)` add `amount` across
  whatever `currency` the rows carry; `rates.currency`/`commission_rates.currency` exist but are never
  filtered/grouped. Harmless while every row is INR.
- **Disposition:** RATCHET — add a currency guard/group if a non-INR rate is ever introduced.

### G-6 · `float8` cast on `numeric` money before `SUM` — 🟢 WONTFIX (minor; revisit if it bites)
- **Severity:** TRIVIAL. **Finding:** `r.amount::float8` / `cmr.amount::float8` (`laterals.ts:21,36`)
  sum in IEEE-754; sub-cent drift possible on large fractional sums. Negligible for current INR integers.
- **Disposition:** WONTFIX for now (cast is intentional for JS number transport); revisit if money
  precision is ever reported wrong.

### G-7 · TAT band system (4/6/8/12/24/48h) is unbuilt — prerequisite for commission-by-TAT — ✅ FIXED (ADR-0044 shipped + consumed by ADR-0046, 2026-06-19)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (newly prioritized prerequisite). **Finding:** the owner recalled TAT bands as
  "built earlier" — they are **not**. ADR-0044 (task-tat-priority) is **Status: Proposed**, nothing in
  the schema (`tat_hours`/`tat_policies`/`due_at` all absent). What exists: the priority enum
  (`0037_case_task_dispatch_fields.sql:43-46`) + an open-task "out of TAT" breach flag from hard-coded
  12/24/48/72h thresholds off `created_at` (`apps/api/src/modules/tasks/repository.ts:13-19`, ADR-0032).
  No "completed-in band" exists anywhere; ADR-0044 explicitly states "Commission unaffected — priority
  is not a commission input" (must be amended). Raw timestamps for elapsed (`assigned_at`,
  `started_at`, `completed_at`) DO exist (server-side `timestamptz`).
- **Disposition:** DEFERRED but **sequenced FIRST** (owner choice 2026-06-18): build/accept the TAT
  band system (elapsed `completed_at − assigned_at`, bucket 4/6/8/12/24/48h, an assign/complete/band
  read-model) + amend ADR-0044 to allow commission as a consumer, **before** the commission rebuild.
  TAT design decisions (clock start, wall-clock vs business-hours, completion-time source,
  target-vs-actual band, full-ADR-0044 vs minimal) pending owner lock in the TAT design phase.

### G-8 · `RATE_LATERAL` location ladder ranks a non-matching scoped rate above the location-less default — 🟡 DEFERRED (discovered 2026-06-19 during ADR-0046)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (latent client-bill correctness). **Finding:** `RATE_LATERAL`
  (`apps/api/src/platform/billing/laterals.ts:21-32`) orders by `(r.location_id = ct.area_id) DESC NULLS
  LAST, …, (r.location_id IS NULL) DESC`. Under Postgres, a row scoped to a **non-matching** location
  yields `FALSE` (a non-null), which sorts **above** the location-less default's `NULL` (nulls last). So
  for a CPV that has both a location-less default rate and a different-location override, a task at a
  *third* location resolves the wrong (override) rate instead of the default. The same flaw was present
  in the new `COMMISSION_LATERAL` and was **fixed there** (collapsed to a single `CASE` rank: match >
  location-less > non-matching; see ADR-0046 spec §3). `RATE_LATERAL` (client bill) was **left
  untouched** — it is governed by ADR-0018 (FROZEN) and out of ADR-0046's scope.
- **Disposition:** DEFERRED — needs a superseding ADR (touches the frozen flat-rate model + changes
  historical client-bill resolution) + owner/CTO sign-off. The same `CASE`-rank fix applies. The
  mirrored `cases/repository.ts:139-149` rate_type display subquery shares the flaw and must be fixed
  together. Real-world impact depends on whether any CPV actually has both a location-less default and a
  location override (verify against prod data before prioritizing). **Must not be silently dropped.**

### G-9 · `toXlsx` omits the formula-injection escape that `toCsv` applies — ✅ FIXED (ADR-0049, MIS build, 2026-06-19)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (was latent across **all** XLSX exports; CWE-1236). **Finding:** `escapeCsvCell`
  prefixes a leading `= + - @ \t \r` with `'` and was applied by `toCsv`, but **`toXlsx` wrote raw cell
  values** — so a cell starting with `=`/`+`/`-`/`@` was a live formula in Excel. Latent for system-text
  exports (billing/locations/tasks); the **MIS export** carries attacker-influenceable free text
  (`form_data`, `DATA_ENTRY_FIELD`, `remark`/`address`), making it exploitable.
- **Disposition:** FIXED platform-wide in `apps/api/src/platform/export/format.ts` — extracted
  `neutralizeFormula(v)` (prefix `'` on a formula-leading STRING; native number/Date/boolean pass
  through) and applied it in `toXlsx`'s cell write; also corrected `escapeCsvCell` to apply the guard
  **AND** RFC-4180 quoting (a formula cell that also contains a comma/quote gets both — the earlier
  "guard-instead-of-quote" form produced invalid CSV). Covered by `platform/export/__tests__/format.test.ts`
  (CSV + XLSX) + the pre-existing `platform/__tests__/export.test.ts`. Full `pnpm verify` green.

### Verified PASS (no finding)
- RBAC: commission config = `masterdata.manage` = SUPER_ADMIN-only; `billing.view` = MANAGER +
  BACKEND_USER + SA; no role accidentally sees amounts (server-nulled fail-safe). A location dimension
  needs **no new permission** (scope-dimension registry). Matches ADR-0036 §3 + the 6-role model.
- The geography substrate (locations, `case_tasks`/`cases` area/pincode, `RATE_LATERAL` cascade) is
  fully live for rates and reusable as the reference model for commission.

## Section R0050 — ADR-0050 rate-type / office two-actor commission: pre-push review gate (2026-06-20)

4-agent adversarial review (CEO · CTO · Design · Security) of the two-rate-type + office flat-commission
build, on top of a green `pnpm verify`. Verdicts: Security **GO**, CEO/Design **GO-with-nits**, CTO
**NO-GO** (one blocker, now fixed). All findings dispositioned below.

### R0050-1 · Migration re-run breaks the 2nd deploy (rename trap) — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-20)
`0083` renames `rate_type`/`distance_band`, but the deploy migrate replays the FULL set every deploy and
earlier migrations reference the OLD names verbatim. **Reproduced** (apply set ×2 on a scratch DB): 2nd
pass hard-failed on `0058` (index on `rate_type` — `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` still resolves columns),
`0079` (`ALTER COLUMN rate_type DROP NOT NULL`), `0083`; and silently resurrected `rates.rate_type` +
`case_tasks.distance_band` (`0013`/`0011`). Same class as the `0037`/`0081` MIS incident. **FIX:** guarded
each old-name block on the renamed column's absence (`IF NOT EXISTS field_rate_type/client_rate_type`) in
`0011`/`0013`/`0058`/`0079` — runs once on a fresh DB / first deploy, no-ops on every re-run; kept the
`rates.rate_type_id` unconditional cleanup (`0012` re-adds it each deploy). **Verified:** 3 consecutive
full deploys apply clean, schema converges (renamed cols only, no-overlap constraints intact). **Guardrail
added:** `apps/api/src/platform/__tests__/migrations.rerun.test.ts` (applies the set ×3, asserts no
resurrected columns). DON'T-REGRESS: any future column RENAME / DROP+ADD CHECK must keep this test green.

### R0050-2 · OFFICE distance-band picker shown on 2 assign surfaces — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-20)
ADR-0050 §3 = no LOCAL/OGL picker for OFFICE (auto-stamped). `AddTasksForm` honored it; `CaseDetailPage`
`AssignForm` + `PipelinePage` `BulkAssignAction` showed it unconditionally (server ignored it → no
corruption, but misleading). Gated both on `visitType==='FIELD'` + clear stale `fieldRateType` on switch.

### R0050-3 · SDK field renames are a wire-contract change (not "additive") — 🟢 WONTFIX/authorized
`rateType→clientRateType`, `distanceBand→fieldRateType` on `/api/v2` request/response schemas. Authorized
by ADR-0050 (supersedes ADR-0046, owner+CTO sign-off — a freeze exception, not a silent break). **Mobile
unaffected:** the `/sync/download` projection emits none of these fields; web FE moves in lockstep.

### R0050-4 · ₹0-on-missing-commission-config is silent — 🟡 DEFERRED (ADR-0050 open item)
A task whose dims match no active commission row earns ₹0 silently (LEFT JOIN → NULL → COALESCE 0);
renders as `—` like "not yet completed". Pre-existing ADR-0050 "Consequences" risk. **Launch-checklist:**
pre-seed OFFICE rates before go-live; ship a distinct "unresolved" indicator (TODO). Not a leak (Security).

### R0050-5 · Office-exec has no in-app Excel-export / relay-state — 🟡 DEFERRED (product follow-up)
The two-actor relay (KYC_VERIFIER downloads→emails source→forwards response; never completes) has no
per-task Excel export affordance and no "sent/received" timestamp, so an ASSIGNED office task is
indistinguishable from a stuck one on aging surfaces. First post-launch ask; not a blocker.

### R0050-6 · Design nits — 🟡 DEFERRED
`AddTasksForm.tsx` separator uses `text-border` as a text color (only such use; prefer
`text-muted-foreground`); FIELD assign-at-create has no client-side guard for the now-required
`fieldRateType` (server 400s — consistent with the form's existing server-refine reliance).

### Verified PASS (Security — no finding)
COMMISSION_LATERAL: `cmr.user_id = ct.assigned_to` is a top-level AND (enforced on the OFFICE branch too);
LOCAL/OGL and OFFICE rate-spaces are disjoint; `fieldRateType` client enum = LOCAL/OGL only (OFFICE is
server-derived from `visit_type`, not client-settable); the MANAGER/TL grant unlocks only the 2 task-close
routes (no money/export/admin); completion stays scope-bound (404, IDOR-safe); all SQL parameterized.

## Section R0054 — ADR-0054 v2-native mobile: 3 app-side findings + pre-release review gate (2026-06-20)

The 3 device-smoke findings from the v2-native cutover (`crm-mobile-native`, branch `feat/v2-native-sync`)
fixed via the multi-agent method, then a 4-agent adversarial review gate (CEO · CTO · Design · Security)
on the green static gate (`tsc --noEmit` + `contract:mobile` 14/14 + eslint). Verdicts: CEO/Design/CTO
**GO-with-fixes**, Security **NO-GO** (one cross-user PII blocker — now fixed). All dispositioned below.
Re-smoked on the real device (Android RZ8M813301M, debug 10073 vs local v2-native :4000): login + consent
sync clean, v2 sync "Downloaded 2 / Available 2", addresses render clean on TaskCard + TaskInfoModal.

### R0054-1 · Address `", ,"` gap when v2 drops city/state — ✅ FIXED + device-verified (2026-06-20)
ADR-0054 made `/sync/download` send one free-text `address` (→ local `addressStreet`) + `pincode` and DROP
city/state (now empty). `TaskCard`/`TaskDetailScreen` rendered `{street}, {city}, {state} {pincode}` → e.g.
"…Mumbai, , 400001". **FIX:** shared `src/utils/formatTaskAddress.ts` — comma-joins the non-empty
street/city/state then appends a space-separated pincode (Indian convention; matches pre-ADR-0054). Unit-
tested 5 edge cases. On-device: "42 MARINE DRIVE, CHURCHGATE, MUMBAI 400020 400001" / "12 MG ROAD, FORT,
MUMBAI 400001" — no stray commas (UI-dump text confirmed).

### R0054-2 · Cross-user wipe threw on `user_session` (whitelist gap) — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-20)
`clearAllData failed during user-change wipe` (the device-smoke toast): `MaintenanceRepository.clearAllTables`
threw on `user_session` because it was missing from `CLEARABLE_TABLES`, aborting the wipe mid-loop (partial
wipe). Root cause was the whitelist gap (pre-existing, commit `5eca463`) — **NOT** the v19→v20 migration the
memory hypothesized. **FIX:** added `user_session` to the whitelist. Statically proven: all StorageService
wipe tables ⊆ `CLEARABLE_TABLES`. Schema/FK/open-timing throw paths ruled out (CTO). **Device-verified**
(R0054-R1): real cross-user login swap → `All local data cleared`, no throw.

### R0054-3 · Cross-user wipe left prior-user PII (notifications + projections) — ✅ FIXED (Security BLOCKER, 2026-06-20)
Even with R0054-2, `StorageService.clearAllData`'s 8-table list omitted `notifications`,
`task_list_projection`, `task_detail_projection`, `dashboard_projection`, `form_templates` — all read
**UNSCOPED** by the UI. Login sync only does incremental `rebuildTask`, never `rebuildAll`, so User A's
tasks/notifications render to User B on first launch (this is exactly the original "stale data didn't clear"
finding). **FIX:** added the 5 tables to the wipe list (all already whitelisted; no FKs → order-free). The
fix completes the wipe; the leak is closed. **Device-verified** (R0054-R1): smokefb saw 0 assigned tasks,
no smokefa cases in Recent Activity, and the notification badge gone after the cross-user swap.

### R0054-4 · TaskInfoModal dropped the pincode / 3 address surfaces diverged — ✅ FIXED + device-verified (2026-06-20)
`TaskInfoModal` used `addressStreet || [...]` → dropped the pincode whenever street was present (always, for
v2), while card/detail showed it — same task, different address per screen (Design). **FIX:** all 3 surfaces
now call `formatTaskAddress(task)`. On-device: the modal shows "…MUMBAI 400020 400001" (pincode present),
identical to the card.

### R0054-5 · versionCode 73 → 10073 — ✅ FIXED + device-verified (2026-06-20)
Stale code 73 vs the `10000+minor` release scheme. **FIX:** `android/gradle.properties` versionCode=10073
(versionName stays 1.0.73). `dumpsys package` on the rebuilt debug APK confirms `versionCode=10073`
(mitigation #4 identifiable build).

### R0054-R1 · on-device cross-user wipe repro — ✅ FIXED + device-verified (2026-06-20)
Closed same day. Seeded a 2nd FIELD_AGENT via the real admin API path (`admin`/`admin123` on local
`:4000`/`crm2_dev` → `POST /users` → `smokefb`/`Field@12345`, CRM-00003) and ran the User-A→User-B login
swap on the real device (RZ8M813301M). Logcat proves the path: `User changed on this device
(4e51…[smokefa] → ae16…[smokefb]); wiping local data` → `[StorageService] All local data cleared` (fires
only after `clearAllTables` returns) → `Login successful` — **no `clearAllData failed`** (the old
`user_session` throw is gone). Visual: smokefb's dashboard shows ASSIGNED/IN-PROGRESS/COMPLETED/SAVED **all
0**, RECENT ACTIVITY has **no** smokefa cases, and the notification bell badge (was "1") is **gone** — i.e.
R0054-3's notifications + projections + dashboard tables were all cleared, zero cross-user leak. (Observed
but pre-existing + dev-only: a background `/auth/refresh` 401 `INVALID_REFRESH` surfaces in the RN LogBox —
appeared for smokefa too [no wipe], invisible in release builds; not a regression.)

### R0054-6 · Cross-user wipe is two independent hardcoded lists (drift) — 🟡 DEFERRED (2026-06-20)
`StorageService.clearAllData`'s wipe list and `MaintenanceRepository.CLEARABLE_TABLES` are separate literals;
a future table added to one and not the other re-introduces R0054-2's partial-wipe bug. A subset-guard test
can't load under the dependency-free `node --experimental-strip-types` runner (native `react-native-fs`
import). **Follow-up:** hoist the wipe list to an exported constant + assert `wipeList ⊆ CLEARABLE_TABLES`,
or derive one from the other.

### R0054-7 · Cross-user wipe non-transactional + failure swallowed — 🟡 DEFERRED (2026-06-20)
`clearAllTables` runs per-table `DELETE` with no transaction, and `AuthService` catches a wipe failure and
**continues login** onto possibly-stale cross-user data. Acceptable now (R0054-2/3 remove the known throw),
but the right cross-user boundary is all-or-nothing + fail-closed (block login on wipe failure). Behavioural
change → its own reviewed change next cycle.

### Process / pre-release checklist
TEMP smoke repoint (`src/config/index.ts` dev → `http://localhost:4000`) **reverted** to the prod HTTPS URL
(it was `__DEV__`-only so could not ship in a release, but a landmine). Owner gate before distribution
(CEO): **staged/canary rollout** (a few field agents first, incl. the R0054-R1 cross-user swap) before
fleet-wide, and confirm the "no other live v2 app" freeze (mitigation #5) still holds at distribution time.

## Section R0056 — ADR-0056 field-rate-type auto-derive: pre-push 4-agent review gate (2026-06-21)

Verdict: **Security GO · CTO GO (conditional) · Design GO · CEO GO.** One blocker (B-1) FIXED; the rest DEFERRED.

### R0056-1 · Derive drops `tat_band` → could stamp a band that resolves ₹0 at submit — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-21)
CTO blocker. The two derive helpers (`cases/repository.ts` `deriveFieldRateTypeForTask`/`…ForNewTask`)
mirror `COMMISSION_LATERAL` minus the `field_rate_type` equality (we derive it) and minus `tat_band`. Among
same-specificity/same-location rows differing by both `field_rate_type` AND `tat_band`, `id DESC` could pick
a tat-band-specific band (e.g. `OGL@4`) that, at submit (completing in another band), resolves ₹0 via
`COMMISSION_LATERAL` (which DOES filter `tat_band`). **FIX:** added a tie-break `(cmr.tat_band IS NULL) DESC`
(after specificity+location, before `id DESC`) so the derive prefers an always-resolvable (tat-band-universal)
band + a test (`rate-preview.api.test.ts` "prefers a tat_band-universal band … (B-1)"). Security confirmed the
worst case was always ₹0, never over-payment, and it is **not a regression** (the old manual-pick model had the
same assign-time→submit-time band drift). **Residual** (the cross-*specificity* case — the most-specific row is
itself tat-band-specific) → 🟡 **DEFERRED**: inherent to any assign-time stamp; band is unknowable until submit;
prod commission rows are overwhelmingly `tat_band=NULL` so this is latent.

### R0056-2 · Save/Add not disabled despite a known-bad preview — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-21, owner-requested)
Design major. **Add-Tasks** now disables the Add button when any submittable FIELD row's chosen executive has
no commission (each `TaskRowEditor` reports its blocked state up by stable row id via `reportBlocked`); the
case-detail **AssignForm** disables Save when `ratePreview.fieldRateTypes.length === 0`. (Pipeline **bulk**
keeps the post-assign per-row `NO_FIELD_COMMISSION` summary — a pre-check across N locations isn't feasible.)

### R0056-3 · Surface WHICH dependency is missing + where to fix it — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-21, owner-requested)
Owner: "user cannot create case/task without the whole dependency map; show a proper message of what's missing."
Each gate now shows an actionable inline message naming the admin page: **CPV** ("map them in Admin → CPV
Mapping"), **client rate** ("set it in Rate Management; bill ₹0 until then"), **field-exec territory** ("assign
one this territory in Admin → User Management"), **commission** ("add one in Commission Rates for this client or
Universal, with a rate type — assignment blocked until then"). All derived from existing UI data (available-units
/ eligible-assignees / rate-preview) — no new endpoint. Applies to Add-Tasks + AssignForm; bulk uses its summary.

### R0056-4 · Case-detail preview passes only `locationId=areaId`, not the full ladder — 🟢 WONTFIX
CTO minor. `CaseDetailPage` AssignForm's preview uses `task.areaId` only, while the server derive checks
`IN (task.area, task.pincode, case.area, case.pincode)`. The warning hint can be a false +/- when pincode/case
location differ; **no money impact** (server is authoritative). AddTasksForm is consistent (area=pincode).

### R0056-5 · Pre-seed commissions before go-live — 🟡 OPS launch-checklist (CEO)
The hard block means FIELD assignment is impossible until an exec has commission at the location. **Pre-seed at
least one Universal LOCAL/OGL `commission_rates` row per active field exec per dispatch territory** before
go-live, else dispatch is blocked fleet-wide. Brief dispatchers on the inline warning.

### Verified PASS (no finding)
Security: no money-leak (derive keys on `cmr.user_id`=assignee; explicit-band hatch can't conjure commission →
₹0 not over-pay), no SQL injection (uuid-validated + `$5::uuid` bound), no IDOR (rate-preview gated `CASE_CREATE`,
FIELD_AGENT excluded; types-only response). CTO: 4 write paths complete + correct; OFFICE auto-stamp intact;
bulk per-row status correct; tx rollback clean; no migration. CEO: delivers the owner's ask (picker removed,
exec-first, auto-derive, block); mobile unaffected (additive). `pnpm verify` GREEN.

## Section R0055-R0056-SHIP — open follow-ups after the combined prod ship (2026-06-22, origin/main `80d95ce`)

ADR-0055 (revoke-before-reassign) + ADR-0056 (field-rate auto-derive) shipped together; deploy gate green.
Three deferred follow-ups, owner-acknowledged:

### SHIP-1 · Bulk-assign bypasses the revoke-before-reassign gate — 🟡 DEFERRED (ADR-0055 follow-up)
Single-assign (`cases/service.assignTask`) is now PENDING-only, but pipeline **bulk-assign**
(`tasks/service.ts:266`) still admits `ASSIGNED` rows and re-points them in place via
`caseRepository.assignTask`, bypassing the gate. Flagged by BOTH the revoke + field-rate sessions as a
coordinated follow-up (the file is the field-rate session's). Restrict bulk to PENDING-only for full
ADR-0055 consistency — owner decision pending (it changes the pipeline bulk-reassign behavior).

### SHIP-2 · "Bill count" is an inconsistent billing multiplier — 🟡 DEFERRED (owner decision pending)
`bill_count` multiplies BOTH the client bill and the commission (`billing/repository.ts:121-122`), but the
**create** form never collects it (defaults to 1) while the inline **Assign** + **bulk** forms do; every
task is `1` in practice. Owner to decide: remove from the assign forms (always ×1, consistent with create) /
keep / add to create. No code change yet.

### SHIP-3 · Stranded location-less PENDING tasks after "remove Assign later" — 🟡 DEFERRED (going-forward fix)
ADR-0056's "remove Assign later" (require visit type + FIELD location at create) is **going-forward** — any
pre-existing bare/location-less PENDING task can't be FIELD-assigned (the inline Assign form has no location
picker; that was the rejected Option B). **Pre-deploy/post-deploy check:** `SELECT count(*) FROM case_tasks
WHERE status='PENDING' AND area_id IS NULL` on prod — if non-zero, revoke/recreate them or revisit the
inline-assign location fix.

## Section AUDIT-2026-06-22 — verification-form field-mapping audit (9 FIELD_VISIT types × 4 layers)

Read-only multi-agent audit. Nothing changed. Full report: `docs/audit-2026-06-22/` (README + per-layer
files). Mobile capture, backend storage, frontend raw-field display, and the field-photo
lat/long→reverse-geocoded-address chain all **PASS** for all 9 types. The break is the **FIELD_REPORT
narrative generator** only — and raw captured fields always still display, so no data is lost.

### AUDIT-1 · FIELD_REPORT narrative renders empty — outcome-vocabulary mismatch — 🔴 CONFIRMED, owner decision pending
Default templates branch (strict `===`) on v1 verbose labels (`"Positive & Door Open"`, `"ERT"`,
`"Untraceable"`, …); the v2 app submits 5 uppercase CODES in `verificationOutcome`
(`POSITIVE`/`SHIFTED`/`NSP`/`ENTRY_RESTRICTED`/`UNTRACEABLE`, `FormSubmissionService.ts:81`,
`VerificationFormScreen.tsx:80`). No backend code→label normalization (`fieldReports/repository.ts:52`
verbatim), so no `{{#eq outcome …}}` branch ever matches → empty body, all 9 types. Tests are green
because `defaults.*.render.test.ts` feed the v1 label, not the device code. Real v1 dump confirms the
labels were the historical vocabulary; the v2 mobile rewrite (`LegacyFormTemplateBuilders.normalizeOutcome`)
collapsed them to codes. **Latent until an admin activates a FIELD_REPORT layout prefilled from the
defaults** (`ReportLayoutsPage.tsx:374-378` one-click). Evidence: `docs/audit-2026-06-22/layer4-template-mapping.md`.

### AUDIT-2 · FIELD_REPORT tenure clauses empty — composite period-key arity — 🔴 CONFIRMED, owner decision pending
Templates read a single `<period>` ref; the app emits split `<period>Value` + `<period>Unit` (~20
instances, 8 types) → empty "for the last … years" clauses. No `concat` helper, so needs a real resolver/
helper, not a rename. Tests mask it by feeding the combined string.

### AUDIT-3 · Secondary per-field ref drifts — 🟡 DEFERRED (P2, medium confidence)
`applicantStayingFloor` vs mobile `addressFloor` (floor clause), `callConfirmation` absence for
BUILDER/NOC, `finalStatusNegative` captured-but-never-printed (APF), `businessExistance` misspelled twin.
Isolated; raw view still shows them; fix after AUDIT-1/2. Confirm each against the exact mobile form.

### AUDIT-4 · Test debt masks the whole class — 🟡 DEFERRED (must fix alongside AUDIT-1/2)
`defaults.*.render.test.ts` feed v1-shaped fixtures (verbose-label outcome + combined period) the v2
device never sends → `pnpm verify` stays green while real reports are blank. Add a contract test that
renders a default template from a **real captured device blob** and asserts a non-empty body.

### Open verification (needs prod/dev DB — not done in this audit)
`SELECT verification_type, is_active FROM report_layouts WHERE template_type='FIELD_REPORT'` on prod →
decides AUDIT-1/2 **live vs latent**. Then one real device submission per type → diff rendered `narrative`.

### Verified PASS (no finding)
Backend verbatim jsonb round-trip + uniform across all 9 slugs (`cases/repository.ts:1413-1418`);
generic raw-field display, no per-type gating, nothing dropped (`fieldReports/sections.ts`,
`CaseDetailPage.tsx:1783-1792`); field-photo lat/long + reverse-geocoded-address full chain with
graceful null fallback, all 9 types (`platform/geocode/*`, `case_attachments.geo_location` +
`reverse_geocoded_address`, `CaseDetailPage.tsx:1860-1906`).

## Section IE-2026-06-22 — Excel/CSV import-export coverage audit & fix (admin/master-data first)

Multi-agent audit (7 page-groups × field matrix) of `.xlsx`/`.csv` import+export coverage so every
add/edit field is importable + exportable, lossless, RBAC-correct, escaped (CWE-1236/G-9), case-correct
(ADR-0058). Full matrices: `docs/audit-2026-06-22/import-export/A1..A7.md` + `README.md`. No frozen
decision changed → **no ADR**; all fixes additive (export manifests + import columns + route guards).
Confirmed platform-wide: imports reuse the SDK Create schema (ADR-0058 transforms run on import, no
bypass); `.xlsx` + `.csv` both accepted; forbidden-import history surfaces expose no import.

### IE-1 · Users export gated by bare `data.export` (PII export wider than read) — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22)
`GET /users/export` required only `data.export`, held by MANAGER/TEAM_LEADER/BACKEND_USER, none of
which hold `page.users` (SUPER_ADMIN-only) — so they could export every user's name/phone/employeeId
(PII) without being able to open the list. Re-gated `USER_VIEW`, mirroring the in-repo
`/scope/export` + billing `/cases/export` precedent (export never wider than read). The test that
*codified* the hole (`BACKEND_USER … can export (200)`) was flipped to assert 403. `users/routes.ts`.

### IE-2 · Field-Monitoring export gated by bare `data.export` — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22)
`GET /field-monitoring/export` (FIELD-agent roster: name/phone/employeeId PII + territory) was
exportable by BACKEND_USER (holds `data.export`, not `page.field_monitoring`). Re-gated
`FIELD_MONITORING_VIEW`. `field-monitoring/routes.ts`.

### IE-3 · Roles export gated by bare `data.export` (RBAC topology disclosure) — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22)
`GET /roles/export` dumped every role's permission set + scope wiring to roles lacking `page.access`.
Re-gated `ACCESS_VIEW`. `roles/routes.ts`.

### IE-4 · Report-Templates export gated by bare `data.export` — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22)
`GET /report-templates/export` was exportable by roles that 403 on the template list (`page.templates`).
Re-gated `TEMPLATE_VIEW`; the `BACKEND_USER can export (200)` test flipped to 403. `reportTemplates/routes.ts`.

### IE-5 · Commission-rate export dropped the resolution dimensions — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22)
`COMMISSION_RATE_EXPORT_COLUMNS` emitted user/client/rateType/amount only — dropping `location` (a
REQUIRED key for LOCAL/OGL), `product`, `verificationUnit`, `tatBand`, `currency` (all on
`CommissionRateView`). Two differently-dimensioned rows exported identically and could not round-trip
(the required location was gone). Added all five (grid-aligned ids). `commissionRates/service.ts`.

### IE-6 · Verification-Unit export lossy (9 of ~23 fields); KYC import impossible — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22)
Export now mirrors the 19 import columns (same headers) + read-only audit cols → an export re-imports
losslessly. Added the `Required Attachments` import column with a `TYPE[:MIN]` round-trip parser/formatter
— KYC_DOCUMENT units (which require ≥1 attachment) could **never** import before. `verificationUnits/service.ts`.

### IE-7 · Rates/Users/CPV round-trip + completeness gaps — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22)
Rates export `+currency` (importable) `+effectiveTo` (history window). Users export `+Email`; users
import `+Phone`. CPV-Mapping export split the combined `"CODE — Name"` cell into separate
`Client/Product Code` (the import key) + `Name` columns → re-importable (round-trip test: export→preview
= 0 errors). `rates/service.ts`, `users/service.ts`, `cpv/service.ts`.

### IE-DEFER-1 → ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22, owner pulled forward) · Users + Designations FK import (department/designation)
Both departments and designations are **name-keyed (unique)**, so no new code surface was needed —
the per-request import builder resolves the FK by NAME via the existing `options()` ({id,name}). Added a
`Department` column to the designation import (matches the export header) + `Department`/`Designation`
columns to the user import (match the export headers); both refactored to file-schema + async `resolve`
builders (`buildDesignationImportSpec` / `buildUserImportSpec`, mirroring cpv/commission). The user file
schema = `CreateUserSchema.omit({departmentId,designationId}).extend({departmentName,designationName})`
so ALL preview validation (username/email/phone/role/password) is preserved; an unknown name → per-row
error against the Department/Designation column (no silent null). A designation/user export now re-imports
losslessly (round-trip tests assert 0 errors). `designations/service.ts`, `users/service.ts`.

### IE-DEFER-2 · CPV unit-enablement leg (`client_product_verification_units`) import/export — 🟡 DEFERRED
The per-mapping unit-enablement leg (`cpvUnitService`) has no bulk import/export. The PRIMARY "CPV
Mapping" surface (client↔product, `client_products`) IS fully covered (down-graded P0→P1). A new
surface (manifest + route + controller + SDK + web + client/product/unit code resolve) — its own slice.

### IE-DEFER-3 · Case Creation bulk import · Bulk Assignment file import · Cases grid export — 🟡 DEFERRED
Case-creation bulk import does not exist (import-mandatory §4) and needs its own ADR — it must reuse
`CreateCaseSchema` and honour ADR-0053 (multi-applicant batch dedupe) + ADR-0056 (visit-type + FIELD
location + derived field-rate) + the dedupe gate. Bulk Assignment is an in-grid JSON action
(`POST /tasks/bulk-assign`), not a spreadsheet import. Cases DataGrid has no `exportFn`; several
case/task fields export nowhere. ALL deferred: the `cases`/`tasks` modules are under concurrent
parallel-session WIP (do not collide), and case-creation import is a feature, not a coverage patch.

### IE-DEFER-4 · MIS/Billing/Field-Monitoring ≥10k export → background job — 🟡 DEFERRED
`mode:all` ≥10k returns 413 `EXPORT_TOO_LARGE` instead of enqueuing a job (standard §2); only
`locations` registers an async export builder. Incremental rollout — register builders per surface.

### IE-DEFER-5 · Policies export — 🟡 DEFERRED
The Policies admin DataGrid has no export (standard §1). Low-risk additive (metadata manifest + route +
SDK + web). Policies *content* stays non-importable (versioned legal blob — WONTFIX).

### IE-DEFER-6 · Scope-assignments export honours filters + emits codes + web surface — 🟡 DEFERRED
The `/users/scope/export` ignores the DataGrid filter/sort, emits resolved labels (import wants codes),
and has API routes but no web button. P1 round-trip/correctness; bundle with IE-DEFER-1.

### IE-8 · Departments + Designations export gated wider than their list — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22, review-panel)
The Security reviewer caught a miss in the IE-1..4 gate sweep: `GET /departments/export` and
`GET /designations/export` were gated bare `data.export` (SA+MGR+TL+BE) while their LIST is `page.users`
(SUPER_ADMIN-only) — so MANAGER/TEAM_LEADER/BACKEND_USER could export the org's department/designation
structure they cannot read. Same export-wider-than-read class as IE-1..4. Low impact (no PII/money/secret
— name/description/dates/status only) but real. Re-gated both `/export` → `USER_VIEW`; the
`BACKEND_USER can export (200)` tests flipped to 403. `departments/routes.ts`, `designations/routes.ts`.

### IE-9 · Review-panel hardening (parser + template discoverability + export consistency) — ✅ FIXED (2026-06-22)
- **CTO P2:** `parseAttachmentList` accepted a blank-type token (`":2"` → `{type:'',min:2}`); now filters
  empty-type tokens. `verificationUnits/service.ts`.
- **Design P2-1:** the VU import template shipped a blank `Required Attachments` sample → the `TYPE[:MIN]`
  grammar was undiscoverable; added a worked sample (`DOCUMENT,PAN:2`) so the template self-documents.
- **Design P3-1:** commission export rendered "applies to any" three ways (`Universal` for client, blank
  for the other dims); now renders `Universal` for all Universal-able dimensions (no blank-vs-missing ambiguity).

### IE-DEFER-7 · Commission-rate export ⇏ commission import template (round-trip shape mismatch) — 🟡 DEFERRED
The Design reviewer noted commission rates have BOTH export and import, but the export is display-oriented
(combined `Location` "411001 Fort", `Product` code+name, `Unit` name, `User` display name, `TAT` "24h")
while the import template is code/pincode-keyed (`Username`, `Location Pincode`+`Area`, `Product Code`,
`Unit Code`, integer `TAT Band`) — so an exported file does not re-import cleanly (unlike CPV/VU/Users/Rates,
which were aligned). The IE-5 P0 (dropped required dimensions / ambiguity) IS fixed; full export↔import
alignment (split Location, emit codes, bare TAT) is a follow-up that conflicts with the FE grid `cols`
ids and so warrants its own pass. Export is documented in-code as read-for-analysis, not a re-import source.

### IE-DEFER-8 · Report Layouts export — 🟡 DEFERRED (discovered 2026-06-23, design-build B3)
The Report Layouts admin DataGrid (`/admin/report-layouts`) has no `exportFn` because the `reportLayouts`
module exposes no `GET /export` route (only `/`, `/by-config`, `/:id`, create/activate/deactivate). Per
IMPORT_EXPORT_STANDARD (no module writes a bespoke export; the DataGrid is the only export surface), the
fix is an **additive backend `/report-layouts/export`** (metadata manifest + route gated `TEMPLATE_MANAGE`
+ SDK `.export()` + web `exportFn`), mirroring the report-templates export precedent — its own slice, not
invented here. The layout *designer artifact* (template body / column-row builder) stays non-importable by
design (see WONTFIX). Low-risk metadata-only export of the list columns (name/kind/client/product/status/dates).

### Review-panel verdicts (4-agent, 2026-06-22)
CTO: NO BLOCKING ISSUES (reuse + additive + contract-safe + tests genuine; round-trip + RBAC traced to
seed). Security: no P0/P1 in the change; the four (now six) gates correctly close real export-wider-than-read
exfils; no secret leak (password_hash is not a UserView field); CWE-1236 guard covers every new cell; the
attachment parser is injection/ReDoS/DoS-safe. CEO: **ACCEPT round-1 (master-data + security)**; two owner
asks — (a) name **Case Creation bulk import** (IE-DEFER-3) the round-2 headliner (highest daily-value admin
workflow), (b) consider pulling **users/designations dept+designation FK import** (IE-DEFER-1) forward — same
code→id resolve pattern this change already proves for CPV/commission. Design: no P1 blockers; P2/P3 above
FIXED or dispositioned (IE-DEFER-7). Pre-existing P3 (not introduced here, logged for a follow-up):
`requiredAttachments` element `{type,min}` shape is unvalidated by the SDK schema (`z.array(z.unknown())`);
constrain `type` to an enum when the field gets a server-side consumer.

### WONTFIX (justified)
Report Templates content blob, Report Layouts designer artifact, Saved Views (per-user opaque state),
System (read-only health), Reference (seeded lookup), Policies content (legal blob) — non-importable by
design. Audit/Billing/Commission/Notification/System-log history — forbidden import (§4), correctly
exposing no import endpoint. MIS money-drop (G-4) verified applied on BOTH `/rows` and `/export`.

## Section H — Frontend design-compliance audit (2026-06-19) — dispositions

The authorized 2026-06-19 `apps/web` design audit (deliverable `docs/design-audit-2026-06-19/`, plan
`docs/plans/2026-06-20-frontend-design-compliance-fix-plan.md`) found **0 P0 · 25 P1 · 56 P2 · 45 P3** —
all *consistency of primitive adoption* on newer/bespoke pages (no architectural breaks). Remediation is
additive (adopt existing primitives) under **[ADR-0051](./adr/ADR-0051-inline-grid-editing-no-modal-forms.md)**
(inline-grid + record-page add/edit) and **[ADR-0052](./adr/ADR-0052-button-action-emphasis-system.md)**
(button affordance). Foundation + Wave 1 + button-migration + Wave 4 (D3/D4) **shipped to prod**
(`origin/main 522d5ac`, 2026-06-23). Wave K / D5 closeout dispositioned below.

### H-1 · RBAC-UI client-gating leaks (write controls shown without `useAuth().has()`) — ✅ FIXED
Foundation F1 centralized `has()` in `useAuth()`; Wave-1 A1 gated Cases `+New`, Rate-Management writes,
and Templates/RBAC/Policies actions on the server perms. The D4 record-page routes (Policies/ReportLayouts/
Roles/CommissionRates/Users/VerificationUnits) each **self-guard** (`if (!has('<perm>')) return <Navigate/>`),
closing the create/edit leak structurally. Shipped `522d5ac`. Server remains authoritative.

### H-2 · Bespoke dialogs/popovers not focus-trapped — ✅ FIXED
A3 focus-trapped the (then) Commission-Rates dialog; A4/F4 moved the header Jobs/Bell/Account popovers to a
shared focus-trapped `Popover`. The Commission-Rates add/edit dialog is now moot (D4 record page). Shipped
`522d5ac`. The RBAC "cannot deactivate" alert gained `role=dialog`+`aria-modal`+`useFocusTrap` (Wave K).

### H-3 · Non-standard loading/error states — ✅ FIXED
A5 standardized Dashboard/Security/Notifications/CPV/Policies on `HexagonLoader` + error/Retry (no
silent-empty; MFA no false-OFF pre-load). Shipped `522d5ac`.

### H-7 · Token slips (`text-st-completed` dead, `text-amber-600` raw) — ✅ FIXED
A2 replaced both with frozen tokens; F5 source-scan guard (`lib/tokens.guard.test.ts`) prevents
regressions. Shipped `522d5ac`.

### H-9 · Add/edit inconsistency (modal forms) → inline-grid + record-page (ADR-0051) — ✅ FIXED (converted set)
**Flat → editable DataGrid per-cell inline + add-row:** Departments, Designations, Clients, Products,
Locations. **Complex → record-page route** `/admin/<entity>/new|:id`: Policies, ReportLayouts, Roles,
CommissionRates, Users (2-tab), VerificationUnits (3 with additive `GET /:id`). All add/edit `*Dialog`s
deleted; shipped `522d5ac`. A regression guard (`apps/web/src/lib/adr0051-no-modal-forms.guard.test.ts`)
fails if any converted entity re-introduces an add/edit modal. Standards updated (`DATAGRID_STANDARD.md §21`,
`MANAGEMENT_LIST_STANDARD.md`). Kept overlays (ConflictDialog/ImportModal/ResetPasswordDialog/Assign) are
not add/edit forms.
- **CPV — 🟡 DEFERRED:** bespoke master-detail accordion (client↔product link + per-unit reschedule); keys
  immutable, only `effectiveFrom` is reschedulable via a tiny single-date dialog + a sanctioned
  `renderExpanded` sub-table. ADR-0051's flat-grid model does not fit; left as-is (documented scope).
- **Templates + Rate-Management — ✅ FIXED (this branch, 2026-06-23):** the last two popup surfaces, both
  converted to record-page routes (backend-additive D4, mirroring Policies + CommissionRates). **Templates:**
  added `GET /api/v2/report-templates/:id` (TEMPLATE_VIEW, reuses `repo.findById`, +integration tests) +
  `TemplateRecordPage` (`/admin/templates/new|:id`); `TemplateDialog` deleted. **Rate-Management:** added
  `GET /api/v2/rates/:id` returning the joined `RateView` (MASTERDATA_VIEW, new `repo.findViewById` factored
  from the list select, +integration tests) + `RateRecordPage` (`/new` create cascade + `/:id` revise =
  amount+effFrom, dims read-only, `POST /:id/revise`); the inline AddRateForm + Revise modal deleted, the
  read-only `HistoryDialog` kept, `SearchableSelect` extracted to `components/ui/`. OpenAPI regenerated;
  the no-modal-form guard test now scans `features/templates` + `features/rateManagement` (HistoryDialog
  whitelisted as a read-only view). Browser-verified create/edit navigation + `GET /:id` hydration; e2e
  `templates.spec` + `rateManagement.spec` added (+ idempotent seed rows, verified on an empty DB). **Only
  CPV remains unconverted** (above) — every other entity is now inline-grid or record-page.

### H-10 · Keyboard navigation (D15) — ✅ FIXED (P1/P2); 🟡 DEFERRED (P3 tail)
- **K1 (P1) — ✅ FIXED:** DataGrid sortable headers + `onRowClick` rows are keyboard-operable
  (tabIndex + Enter/Space, focus-visible ring, `aria-sort` retained) — fixes every grid (Playwright
  e2e in `datagrid.spec.ts`).
- **K2/K3 — ✅ FIXED:** `.input` focus ring restored; RateManagement `SearchableSelect` keyboard combobox;
  skip-to-content link; RBAC deactivate-alert focus-trap (shipped `522d5ac`); MustAcceptPolicies scroll
  region keyboard-focusable (`role=region`/`tabIndex`, this branch).
- **DataGrid `role=menu` arrow-key roving — 🟡 DEFERRED (P3):** the column/export/filter menus are already
  keyboard-operable (focus-trap + Tab + Enter + Escape; axe-green) — arrow-roving is an ARIA best-practice
  enhancement, not an axe-failing violation. Deferred to avoid destabilizing the critical 1.4k-line shared
  grid (40 passing grid e2e) for a P3.

### H-11 · Button affordance / action-emphasis (ADR-0052) — ✅ FIXED
Shared `<Button>` variant system (primary/secondary-tonal/destructive/ghost/link + loading/iconOnly +
Export ↓ / Import ↑ glyphs), AA-contrast in light+dark, ~130 `.btn` + 21 text-link sites migrated, `.btn`
CSS retired, dark-mode toggle. Shipped `522d5ac`.

### H-B2 · Bespoke tables a11y/responsive contract — ✅ FIXED (this branch)
Bespoke (non-DataGrid) tables adopt the keyboard-focusable `<ScrollRegion>` (CaseDetail ×3, CaseCreate,
MIS, Import, Profile, UserRecord), `scope="col"` on every bespoke `<th>`, and `.rtable`/`data-label` so
Profile + UserRecord policy-acceptance tables collapse to labelled mobile cards. Browser-verified
`/cases/:id` (not in the e2e gate); a11y + viewport green.

### H-B3 · Export/pagination contract — ✅ FIXED (code) + 🟡 DEFERRED (missing endpoints)
- **Users "Export Scope" → `apiExport`** (this branch): was a bare `apiBlob` download; now routes through
  the job-aware helper so a ≥-threshold export returns a 202 background job (toast) instead of a sync blob.
- **`exportFn` where the backend `/export` exists:** all admin/master-data DataGrids already wire it. The
  remaining DataGrids WITHOUT a list-export endpoint are NOT invented (IMPORT_EXPORT_STANDARD — no bespoke
  export): **Cases** (only `/dedupe-search/export` exists → `IE-DEFER-3`), **Policies** (`IE-DEFER-5`),
  **ReportLayouts** (`IE-DEFER-8`, new). Each is an additive backend gap, deferred.
- **CaseDetail task/attachment lists** = array-by-design (per-case bounded sets returned with the case, not
  separately paginated, like `/cases/available-units`); no DataGrid export — documented, not a gap.

### H-C2 · URL-state column filters on the remaining lists — ✅ FIXED (server-whitelisted) + 🟡 N/A (no server filter)
The DataGrid already persists search/sort/page to the URL on every list; C2 exposes the column filters the
server `*_PAGE_SPEC.filterMap` already whitelists (the `f_<id>` contract): **CommissionRates** (+`user`,
`client`, `fieldRateType` text filters; dates already wired), **ReportLayouts** (+`client`/`product`/`name`
text, `kind` Excel multi-select, `createdAt`/`updatedAt` date filters — was 0). **Roles** + **RateManagement**
already exposed their full filterMap (no change). **CaseDetailPage** task-bucket tab now persists to `?tab=`
(bookmarkable). Only filters the server whitelists were added (an unwhitelisted `f_*` is silently dropped, so
none were invented). **FieldMonitoring + Dedupe — 🟡 N/A:** field-monitoring has NO `filterMap` (no column
filter is server-supported → would need an additive backend spec), and Dedupe's filter surface IS its
search form (name/PAN/mobile/company), not per-column grid filters — both left as-is by design.

### H-B1 · Record-page form validation → canonical @crm2/sdk zod (no new dep) — ✅ FIXED (this branch)
Owner-decided (no `react-hook-form`: it isn't in the frozen stack, and OCC `ConflictDialog` is already wired
on every record page). A small pure helper `apps/web/src/lib/zodForm.ts` `zodFieldErrors(schema, values)`
(unit-tested) runs the same `Create<X>`/`Update<X>` schema the server enforces and returns field→message;
the 6 record-page forms (Policy, Role, CommissionRate [create only — Revise has no create-shaped schema],
User [Profile tab], VerificationUnit, ReportLayout) validate-before-mutate and render inline per-field
errors. Browser-verified (an invalid amount blocks the submit + shows the inline error) + the 6 entity e2e
specs confirm valid create/edit is not false-blocked. CaseCreate/CaseDetail/Locations already had rich
inline validation — left as-is.

### Design-build status (this branch — all fix-plan items dispositioned)
Foundation + Wave 1 + button-migration + Wave 4 (D3/D4) shipped to prod (`522d5ac`). The follow-up branch
completed the remainder: **K1/K3** (keyboard), **D5** (guard + standards), **B2** (tables), **C3**
(consistency), **B3** (export), **C2** (URL filters), **B1** (form validation), and the **last two popup
conversions — Templates + Rate-Management** (record-page routes + additive `GET /:id`, H-9 above) — all FIXED.
**ADR-0051 is now complete for every entity except CPV** (bespoke master-detail accordion, intentionally
left). Remaining DEFERRED (documented): CPV inline-grid; DataGrid `role=menu` arrow-roving (P3);
Cases/Policies/ReportLayouts/FieldMonitoring additive backend export+filter endpoints (IE-DEFER-3/5/8, H-C2).

## Section AUDIT-2026-06-23 — Mobile Verification Round-Trip Audit

> Merged into this registry 2026-06-24 (audit close-out; **audit-only — no source code changed**). Source of truth: `docs/audit-2026-06-23/findings.json` (153 raw confirmed findings, 12 tracks) + `README.md` (80-row deduped table). One line per **deduped** finding (`A2026-0623-NN`), each ended **FIXED / DEFERRED / RATCHET / WONTFIX**. Default for anything not yet fixed = **DEFER(RED)** with a one-line rationale. Severity/hop in brackets; affected track(s) in parens; `src:` lists the raw finding ids + lens (C=CEO, T=CTO, D=Designer, S=Security). Owner/CTO to action the **FIX** items (none applied by the audit). `FIX` here = confirmed defect, fix scoped but not yet shipped → still **open** in the registry sense.

**Disposition rollup:** FIX 33 · DEFER 35 · RATCHET 1 · WONTFIX 11 (of 80 deduped). `FIX` = confirmed defect, fix scoped but **not yet applied** (still open in the registry sense — treat as DEFERRED-with-a-plan until shipped). Cross-references: **A2026-0623-** entries `08` (bulkAssign) ≈ registry **SHIP-1** (built-not-pushed); `01`/`02` partially overlap stale registry **AUDIT-1/2/3** (re-disposition those FIXED/open per `RESI-F4`).

### Fix log — report-render cluster (2026-06-24)

Built TDD against the mobile builder (`LegacyFormTemplateBuilders.ts` = source of truth: every form field per type×outcome is mandatory, so an empty report row is a report-side key/mapping bug). Full `DATABASE_URL=… pnpm verify` GREEN; `fieldReports` suite 83 tests. Verified per-type via a `report-render-mapping-gaps` workflow (mobile field set vs `sectionMap`/SDK, each gap adversarially re-checked).

**✅ FIXED (raw-sections view; narrative where live):**
- **A2026-0623-01** split-tenure recombine — `sections.ts` `recombinePeriods` + `canonicalize.ts` `PERIOD_BASES` export (every `<base>Value`+`Unit` now recombines into the named period row; split keys no longer leak to Additional Details).
- **A2026-0623-03** BUSINESS area reads device `officeApproxArea` — `sectionMap.ts` + SDK `fieldReportDefaults.ts`.
- **A2026-0623-08** residence/RCO floor reads device `addressFloor` (was `applicantStayingFloor`; killed the `ordinal('')→"0th floor"` fabrication) — `sectionMap.ts` ×2 + SDK ×2.
- **A2026-0623-14** BUSINESS `addressLocatable` + `addressStatus` mapped.
- **A2026-0623-21** NOC `addressLocatable` + `businessExistance` (NSP) mapped.
- **A2026-0623-22** PROPERTY_APF `addressLocatable` + `tpcConfirmation1/2` mapped. *(`finalStatusNegative` part DEFERRED → entangled with A2026-0623-07 APF-NEGATIVE owner decision.)*
- **A2026-0623-23 / -15** PROPERTY_INDIVIDUAL `flatStatus` (+ `addressLocatable`) mapped.
- **A2026-0623-27** BUILDER `businessExistance` (NSP) mapped.
- **A2026-0623-35 / -37** DSA_CONNECTOR `businessExistance` (NSP) + `addressLocatable` mapped.

**✅ NEW siblings found during the fix (same SoT class, were unregistered) — FIXED:**
- **A2026-0623-03b** RCO business area read `approxArea` but the RCO device emits `officeApproxArea` (mobile builder line 2570; the mapping-gap workflow's RCO agent missed it, confirmed by direct grep) — `sectionMap.ts` + SDK fixed.
- **A2026-0623-21b** RCO `documentType` + `addressLocatable`, PI `addressLocatable`, BUSINESS/NOC/BUILDER/DSA `businessExistance` (NSP) — all unmapped device keys, now mapped.

**WONTFIX (intentional, documented):**
- **A2026-0623-50 / -53 / -55 / -61** dead-duplicate `metPersonName` rows — `sectionMap.ts:13-15` documents the ERT-duplicate transcription as deliberate spec parity; `buildSections` dedupes (first-wins) so the second never renders by design. Removing deviates from spec for zero functional gain. (The PI duplicate was also adversarially **refuted**.)

**REFUTED (audit error, no change):**
- **A2026-0623-62** + the NOC equivalent — claimed `callConfirmation` is a dead field the device never captures; the BUILDER/NOC device **does** emit `callConfirmation`. Verified false.

**DEFERRED:**
- **A2026-0623-28** BUILDER `feedbackFromNeighbour` ERT-only mislabel — cosmetic; per-slug labels aren't outcome-aware and the value renders correctly.
- **SDK narrative columns** for the newly-mapped fields — the narrative view is latent for all 8 affected types (no active `FIELD_REPORT` layout) and a column without a template-body reference renders nothing; add when a layout is activated. The live fix is the raw-sections `sectionMap`.

**✅ Live E2E verification (2026-06-24):** drove the full workflow on `crm2_dev` (seed case+task → assign smokefa → submit form + 5 photos + selfie → office-complete) for residence×POSITIVE. Verified: `case_tasks.form_data['residence']` captured every key (`addressLocatable`, `addressFloor`, split `stayingPeriodValue/Unit`); raw report sections render each field with correct grammar — **"Staying Period = 5 Years"** (split-tenure recombine), **"Applicant Staying Floor = 3"** (no "0th floor" fabrication), no "Not provided"; 6 attachments (5 photos + selfie) stored; **commission ₹50 frozen @SUBMIT + bill_count 1**, **client bill ₹1100 resolved @COMPLETE** (ADR-0047 two-stage), case rollup `billTotal 1100 / commissionTotal 50`. The run **caught + FIXED a NEW gap**: RESIDENCE + OFFICE `addressLocatable` (device emits it, 4 outcomes each, mobile builder lines 1512/1785/1970/2141 + 3312/3532/3736/3896) was unmapped → now in 'Verification Outcome & Status'. `fieldReports` 85 tests + `pnpm verify` green.
